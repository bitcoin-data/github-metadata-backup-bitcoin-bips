The Specification section seems like a good starting point for a conversation on the mailing list about the approach. It would be preferable if the proposal had seen more discussion and the document were further developed before being submitted here. We recommend that authors iterate on a pull request against their own fork of the BIPs repository at the early sketch stage as it doesn’t make sense to bombard other subscribers of this repository with notifications while the proposal is just starting to take shape.\r\n\r\nI’m going to turn this into a draft pull request, but I would recommend that it be closed and reopened at a later time when the proposal is fleshed out more.\r\n\r\nAlso, please look into why your commit is labeled as having been authored by Janus—that’s just weird.",

      "body": "Because the details aren't specified, it's not quite clear how this would differ from BIP-360. As Murch mentioned, it would make sense to at least contrast this with that BIP. There seems to be some overlap, and the parts that don't overlap, such as PQC KEM, might be better specified as a separate BIP. If I were to make a suggestion, maybe this BIP could focus on Group 2 algorithms (for communication between nodes and wallets, as the pqc-bitcoin readme states) and BIP-360 would cover Group 1. Do you think that might make sense?",

So, what you're saying take Group 1 out as it covered in your BIP-360 and just foucs on Group 2 algorithms for communications between nodes, and wallets.  It makes sense but let me tell the following:\n\n1.  Main objective of pqcBitcoin was a holistic implementation pqc repo.\n\n2.  If we go this suggestion, we need to know how to integrate your BIP-360 (seems Group 1) and Group 2.",

The document that I’m seeing consists largely of bullet points that amount to outlining an approach.\n\nUpon review, I find that this document does not meet our baseline expectations regarding technical soundness, clarity, and completeness. My comments regarding the prior version stand, especially that the purpose of a BIP is to provide a detailed Specification with _sufficient detail that other projects can implement the proposed feature_. The prototype/reference implementation appears to be missing crucial parts of the proposed feature.\n\nI appreciate the effort invested and encourage you to review the guidelines to BIP authors in BIP 2 and BIP 3 as well as other BIPs that propose new output types and soft forks before considering a revised submission.",

It integrates cryptographic primitives that are resistant to quantum computing-based attacks.\n+\n+### Proposed Algorithm\n+- **Algorithm Choice**: The proposal suggests utilizing lattice-based algorithms such as **Kyber** for key exchange and **NTRU** for signatures as post-quantum alternatives to the traditional ECDSA and ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman).\n+- **Integration with Bitcoin**: This proposal does not aim to replace Bitcoin’s existing cryptography but to introduce hybrid solutions, where PQC algorithms are used alongside traditional ones, offering a gradual transition period.\n+- **Quantum-Safe Key Management**: The proposal suggests leveraging a hybrid approach where users can generate Bitcoin addresses using PQC methods, alongside existing methods for backward compatibility during the transition period.\n+\n+### Implementation in Bitcoin\n+- **Key Changes to Bitcoin**: \n+  - Replace existing signature verification with the PQC signature scheme.\n+  - Introduce a flag to indicate whether a transaction is using the post-quantum secure method.\n+  - Ensure backward compatibility by maintaining ECDSA signatures for users who don’t implement the PQC methods.\n+\n+### Transition Plan\n+- **Phased Rollout**: The implementation of PQC can be rolled out in phases, with soft forks to accommodate the transition.\n+- **Backward Compatibility**: Bitcoin will continue to accept ECDSA signatures while supporting the new PQC signatures.

Key Format and Management ===\n+\n+* **PQC_KEY** – byte array (256–2048 bytes) plus algorithm ID metadata.  \n+* **HYBRID_KEY** – concatenation of classical ECDSA public key and PQC public key.  \n+* Wallets tag keys with algorithm identifiers and derivation paths (e.g., `m/86'/…/pqctype`).\n+\n+=== 2. Signature Scheme Support ===\n+\n+Supported PQC signature algorithms (Group 1):\n+\n+* SPHINCS+ (stateless hash-based)  \n+* CRYSTALS-Dilithium (lattice-based)  \n+* FALCON (compact lattice-based)  \n+* SQIsign (experimental isogeny-based)\n+\n+**Hybrid signature** format is defined as:\n+\n+HYBRID_SIG = <length_of_ECDSA_signature (1 byte)> || <ECDSA_signature> || <PQC_signature> || <algorithm_id (1 byte)>\n+\n+Validation of hybrid signatures requires both classical and PQC signature verification to succeed independently.\n+\n+=== 3. Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEM) ===\n+\n+To enable quantum-resistant secure channel establishment (e.g., for encrypted wallet backups, P2P communication), this proposal integrates KEMs:\n+\n+* Kyber (lattice-based)  \n+* FrodoKEM (LWE-based)  \n+* NTRU (lattice-based)\n+\n+Shared secrets are derived via:\n+\n+SHARED_SECRET = HKDF(ECDH_SECRET || PQC_KEM_SECRET)\n+\n+\n+An optional non-consensus opcode `OP_KEMNEGOTIATE` is introduced for use in scripts, enabling experimental KEM-based protocols without affecting consensus.\n+\n+=== 4. Backward Compatibility ===\n+\n+Backward compatibility is ensured through:\n+\n+* New SegWit output types (e.g., `p2pqcsig`, `p2hybridsig`) for PQC and hybrid scripts.  \n+* Legacy nodes will ignore unknown scripts safely or treat PQC-only outputs as anyone-can-spend/unspendable.  \n+* Hybrid keys/signatures allow transactions to be validated by both classical and PQC-aware nodes during the transition.\n+\n+=== 5. Node and Wallet Configuration Flags ===\n+\n+Nodes and wallets can enable and configure PQC features using the following command-line flags:\n+\n+-pqc=0|1 # Enable or disable all PQC features (default: 1)\n+-pqcalgo=kyber,ntru,... # Specify enabled KEM algorithms\n+-pqcsig=sphincs,dilithium,... # Specify enabled PQC signature algorithms\n+-pqchybridkeys=0|1 # Enable hybrid key generation (default: 1)\n+-pqchybridsig=0|1 # Enable hybrid signature verification (default: 1)\n+\n+\n+=== 6. Fork Status ===\n+\n+This BIP is designed to be implemented as a **soft fork**, utilizing:\n+\n+* New SegWit output types to introduce PQC-enabled outputs without invalidating existing ones.  \n+* Optional `OP_RETURN`-based script extensions for experimental features.  \n+\n+Activation mechanisms (e.g., BIP-8 or BIP-9 version bits signaling) will be proposed following testnet deployment and community consensus.\n+\n+=== 7. Test Vectors and Validation ===\n+\n+Test vectors are included covering:\n+\n+* PQC key generation across all supported algorithms.  \n+* Creation and verification of PQC-only and hybrid signatures.  \n+* Script-level validation of PQC signatures and hybrid transaction processing.  \n+* Key encapsulation shared secret derivation and secure communication handshake.\n+\n+These are integrated into the Bitcoin Core test framework and located in `doc/pqc.md` and `test/pqc_*`.\n+\n+== Reference Implementation ==\n+\n+Reference implementation repository:  \n+https://github.com/QBlockQ/pqc-bitcoin\n+\n+Features include:\n+\n+* PQC-enabled wallet and key management supporting quantum-safe address generation.  \n+* Modified Bitcoin node with support for validating both ECDSA and PQC signatures.  \n+* Test vectors and unit/integration tests validating PQC functionality.  \n+* Implementation of hybrid signature schemes and KEM-based secure communication.",
