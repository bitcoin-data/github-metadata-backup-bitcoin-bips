The original idea appears to have been that the highest sequence number should dominate and miners should prefer it over lower sequence numbers. This was never really implemented, and the half implemented code seemed to be making this assumption that miners would honestly prefer the higher sequence numbers, even if the lower ones were much much more profitable. That turns out to be a dangerous assumption, and so most technical people have assumed that kind of sequence number mediated replacement was useless, because there was no way to enforce \"honest\" behaviour, as even a few rational (profit maximizing) miners would break that completely. The change described by this BIP provides the missing piece that makes sequence numbers do something significant with respect to enforcing transaction replacement without assuming anything other than profit-maximizing behaviour on the part of miners.",

This means that a higher sequence number can always be included earlier than a lower one (even if the time the original coins being spent was unknown when the transaction was authored). Because of this, even rational miners should go along with the scheme: Take the higher sequence number and collect the fees, or skip over it in the hopes that no one else takes a higher number before the next available lower number becomes spendable. And, of course, users are not constrained to make their sequence numbers go down only one at a time. So it's \"take the most updated version, now, or gamble that no one in the next dozen blocks takes the most updated and that you manage to include the next to most when it finally becomes mineable.\" This is similar to how lock-time works. In fact, this scheme is precisely a per-input relative lock-time.\n+\n+==Example: Bidirectional payment channel==\n+\n+A bidirectional payment channel can be established by two parties funding a single output in the following way: Alice funds a 1btc output which is the 2-of-2 multisig of Alice AND Bob, or Alice's key only after a sufficiently long timeout, e.g. 30 days or 4320 blocks. The channel-generating transaction is signed by Alice and broadcast to the network.\n+\n+Alice desires to send Bob a payment of 0.1btc. She does so by constructing a transaction spending the 1btc output and sending 0.1btc to Bob and 0.9btc back to herself. She provides her signature for the 2-of-2 multisig constraint, and sets a relative lock-time using the sequence number field such that the transaction will become valid 24-hours or 144 blocks before the refund timeout. Two more times Alice sends Bob a payment of 0.1btc, each time generating and signing her half of a transaction spending the 1btc output and sending 0.2btc, then 0.3btc to Bob with a relative lock-time of 29 days from creation of the channel.\n+\n+Bob now desires to send Alice a refund of 0.25btc. He does so by constructing a transaction spending the 1btc output and sending 0.95btc (= 0.7btc + 0.25btc) to Alice and 0.05btc to himself. Since Bob will still have in his logs the transaction giving him 0.7btc 29 days after the creation of the channel, Alice demands that this new transaction have a relative lock-time of 28 days so she has a full day to broadcast it before the next transaction matures.\n+\n+Alice and Bob continue to make payments to each other, decrementing the relative lock-time by one day each time the channel switches direction, until the present time is reached or either party desires to close out the channel. A close-out is performed by setting the relative lock-time to zero (nSequence = MAX_INT) and both parties signing.\n+\n+==Implementation==\n+\n+A reference implementation is provided in the following git repository:\n+\n+https://github.com/maaku/bitcoin/tree/sequencenumbers\n+\n+==Acknowledgements==\n+\n+Credit goes to Gregory Maxwell for providing a succinct and clear description of the behaviour of this change, which became the basis of this BIP text.\n+\n+==Deployment==\n+\n+We reuse the double-threshold switchover mechanism from BIPs 34 and 66, with the same thresholds, but for nVersion = 4. The new rules are in effect for every block (at height H) with nVersion = 4 and at least 750 out of 1000 blocks preceding it (with heights H-1000..H-1) also have nVersion = 4. Furthermore, when 950 out of the 1000 blocks preceding a block do have nVersion = 4, nVersion = 3 blocks become invalid, and all further blocks enforce the new rules.\n+\n+It is recommended that this soft-fork deployment trigger include other related proposals for improving Bitcoin's lock-time capabilities, such as BIP 65: OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY.",
