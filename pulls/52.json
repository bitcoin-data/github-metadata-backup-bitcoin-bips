The software needs to know what coin you're talking about any way, and you're dropping the only place where this information is serialized (the 4 byte magic).\n\nMy suggestion would be to have a BIP32 seed be coin-agnostic, but modify the master node generation algorithm to include the cointype in the HMAC key. That way, each coin can define its own magic, and never risk importing an incompatible chain, while at the same time guaranteeing that no keys will be reused across coins. There's no reason why testnet would be special as the only extra coin.\n",

For example:\n\nWe propose the following tree structure for BIP32:\n\n<pre>\nm / purpose' / *\n</pre>\n\nWhere the purpose value determines the structure beneath. This BIP defines one purpose (with id 0x40), and associated structure:\n\n<pre>\nm / 40' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index\n</pre>\n\nPS: I'm very much in favor of standardizing this further, so don't let my criticism on some details derail this.\n",

I'd love to see it standardized.\n\nThe second part, a proposal for your specific \"purpose 64\" structure I think should wait until there are (preferably more than one) implementations of it. I suspect a lot of the other wallets will pick a (slightly) different structure. No need to put every proprietary structure into a BIP unless its clear there will be at least a minimal level of interoperability.\n",

Heck, we haven't even got to the point of approving the BIP, we are just stuck even BEFORE Drafting stage.\n\nTo sum it up: either you merge this request as BIP64 or we'll deal with this in another manner.\n",

On the other hand, I think your timeline should not put any pressure on the standardization process.\n\nEven if both parts of the BIP will be merged at the same time, I still think it should be different BIPs. Otherwise, other structure BIPs need to reference to \"BIP64 part 1\" or something like that. Your BIP feels a bit like you want to put TCP and HTTP into one document.\n\nCurrently, I think you're the only user of your \"purpose 64\" structure.\n- bitcoinj: Will not implement accounts and coin_type, at least not in the first version. Means it needs to pick a different \"purpose\". See hdw_alpha branch.\n- Electrum: Thomas has previously stated he wants this reserved field. I'm not sure about if that changed.\n- BOP: Has completely different needs as its target is merchants.\n- MultiBit: It appears they're either doing their own thing with MultiBit HD or will adopt the bitcoinj structure.\n- any others I'm not aware of?\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Just release myTrezor and see if someone picks up the structure. We can agree on a BIP once that happens.\n\nBy the way, I thought Trezor (the hardware) is agnostic of any structure, other than the BIP32 derivation rules itself? Is that no longer true?\n",

There is just unwillingness to merge the draft.\n@schildbach About \"BIP64 part 1\" - I see the need to split this into a separate proposal, but I am doing no effort in this direction until this draft is merged in.\n@schildbach Yes, right, TREZOR is structure agnostic. We are talking about myTREZOR here. But since it is the only wallet that supports TREZOR atm we need to have the structure set it stone.\nmyTREZOR is using BOP as its backend server, so it supports BIP64 as of now (although BOP is structure agnostic as well, but knowing the used structure can allow it to improve caching, etc).  Not sure about MultibitHD/BitcoinJ but if they want to use accounts there's no reason why not to use BIP64.\n",

      "body": "@prusnak The purpose of a standard is to build something together, something which has been at least exposed to public scrutiny and had a fair opportunity to be enhanced as a result of it, and hopefully one that more than one party think they will implement so that they can inter-operate. With BIPs we don't even demand that the ideas be considered \"good\", though they do need to survive public scrutiny. Here I asked for the most modest of collaboration— to follow the process and take a number assignment— and your response sounds to me like a veiled threat.  With this kind of approach I do not think a useful standard can result.\n\nI hope you'll reconsider your approach, I think many people here would like to collaborate with you and the result would benefit everyone.  If you are unable to take the time to collaborate at all right now no one could blame you for this: collaboration takes time and work and business sometimes makes other demands. But if so, then the BIP process is probably not the right venue for your specification. \n\nWrt other wallets: This isn't the time/place to debate the content in general. But since a list was provided above: I do not believe that Bitcoin-QT would implement the current draft: Tied secrets for multiwallet results in non-ideal key management (including preventing mutual denyability of separate wallets, to use a use-case from a prior bit), because of the lack of multi-factor support, and because of the lack of support for recurring payment chains. (I also consider the chain identifier inelegant, but at least the sort of thing that could be tolerated for interoperability. Not so for the feature constraints).\n",

Those people maybe don't realize that I have other things to work than battle for hours because of one non-controversial PR.\n\nDiscussing the topic in private and public mailing lists, spend hours and hours arguing for my ideas, writing down documents which are completely useless for ME and my team and trying to standardize things in Bitcoin world for better interoperability is then blocked by people who feels like they have some superpower by blocking these proposals in github, even when there's no obvious real reason to do so.\n\nYears ago I was able to edit such things in bitcoin.it wiki and nobody really cared.

I didn't take it too seriously and I even tried to use humour before. Obviously it didn't work.\n\nThat joke with 2x32 - I really don't think @sipa care at all, having number \"64\" doesn't mean that the proposal is any better than \"32\". That renaming is just... another burreucracy. There's already discussion about \"BIP64\" in the wild, 64 is free to use, 64 is nice number for given topic..... yet if you say it MUST be 43, it WILL be 43... :-/\n",

      "body": "FWIW— Yes, I allocated you numbers per your request over a year ago and you have not done anything with them. When the BIP42 came up it was the next number available without an actual topic assigned and the number worked out nicely (the pull req number was even 42). It did not disrupt any actual assignments as only 40 and 41 were assigned. Reserving space to avoid breaking up a sequence doesn't make a lot of sense when there isn't even a single spec in the sequence.  Keep in mind, it's just a number. Making a fuss about a number and steadfastly refusing to alter even this smallest thing in something thats supposted to be a public process? I think thats \"absurd theater\" if anything is.\n\n>  because potentially it will be something what people will be dealing in wallet software comparsion table\n\nYes, and although it wasn't initially apparent to me not that it's come up it seems to me that it isn't proper to privilege a specification that a more-or-less a single vendor is pushing with a snazzy number like that (it didn't even occur to me that it was a snazzy number at first). The dialog in this discussion make it seem to me that the purpose of this proposal isn't to use the standard process to produce something better, or even something that multiple implementers can agree on, but rather to create a veneer of officiality for a non-negotiable vendor specific specification to use as a competitive bludgeon.  I think we do intend the process to be open enough to include single-vendor-specs, but I don't think that extends as far as getting choice of numbers in order to make the existence of the BIP easier to misuse.\n\nIn any case, I'm happy with the plan to split. I think that fits a lot better with what people have indicated a willingness to implement.\n",

      "diff_hunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,296 @@\n+<pre>\n+  BIP:     BIP-0064\n+  Title:   Hierarchy for Deterministic Wallets\n+  Authors: Marek Palatinus <slush@satoshilabs.com>\n+           Pavol Rusnak <stick@satoshilabs.com>\n+  Status:  Draft\n+  Type:    Standards Track\n+  Created: 04-04-2014\n+</pre>\n+\n+==Abstract==\n+\n+This BIP defines logical hierarchy for deterministic wallets based on algorithm\n+described in BIP-0032 (BIP32 from now on). It is a particular application of\n+the general idea described there.\n+\n+==Motivation==\n+\n+Although Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet structure as described by BIP32\n+is an important step in user experience and security of the cryptocoin wallets,\n+the BIP32 specification offers implementors too many degrees of freedom.\n+Multiple implementations may claim they are BIP32 compatible, but in fact\n+they can produce wallets with different logical structures making them\n+non-interoperable. This situation unfortunately renders \"BIP32 compatible\"\n+statement rather useless.\n+\n+We propose the following tree structure to be applied on top of BIP32:\n+\n+<pre>\n+m / purpose' / *\n+</pre>\n+\n+where the purpose value determines the structure beneath. This BIP defines\n+one purpose (with id 64') and the associated structure (see chapter \"Path\n+levels\" below). This guarantees that master nodes and wallet structures\n+generated in BIP64 compatible software are interoperable among different\n+these independent implementations.\n+\n+Hierarchy proposed in this paper is quite comprehensive. It allows to handle\n+multiple coins, multiple accounts, external and internal chains per account and\n+millions of addresses per chain.\n+\n+Not all wallets may want to support wide range of features and possibilities.\n+Instead of choosing arbitrary subset of defined features and calling themselves\n+BIP64 compatible, we suggest that software which needs only a limited structure\n+should describe such structure in another BIP and use different \"purpose\" value\n+in the proposed BIP32 path below.\n+\n+==Path levels==\n+\n+We define the following 5 levels in BIP32 path:\n+\n+<pre>\n+m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index\n+</pre>\n+\n+Apostrophe in the path indicates that BIP32 hardened derivation is used.\n+\n+Each level has special meaning described in the chapters below.\n+\n+===Purpose===\n+\n+Purpose is a constant set to 64' (0x80000040). It indicates that the subtree\n+of this node is used according to this specification.\n+\n+For BIPs describing different wallet structures, we suggest to use different\n+constant (e.g. BIP number) , so addresses won't be generated overlapping BIP32\n+spaces.\n+\n+Hardened derivation is used at this level.\n+\n+===Coin type===\n+\n+One master node (seed) can be used for unlimited number of independent\n+cryptocoins such as Bitcoin, Litecoin or Namecoin. However, sharing the same\n+space for various cryptocoins has some disadvantages.\n+\n+This level creates a separate subtree for every cryptocoin, avoiding\n+reusing addresses across cryptocoins and improving privacy issues.\n+\n+Coin type is a constant set for each cryptocoin. Cryptocoin developers may ask\n+for registering unused number for their project.\n+\n+The list of already allocated coin types is in the chapter\n+\"Registered coin types\" below.\n+\n+Hardened derivation is used at this level.\n+\n+===Account===\n+\n+This level splits the key space into independent user identities,\n+so the wallet never mixes the coins across different accounts.\n+\n+User can use these accounts to organize the funds in the same\n+fashion like bank accounts; for donation purposes (where all\n+addresses are considered public), for saving purposes,\n+for common expenses etc.\n+\n+Accounts are numbered from index 0 in sequentially increasing manner.\n+This number is used as child index in BIP32 derivation.\n+\n+Hardened derivation is used at this level.\n+\n+Software should prevent a creation of an account if previous account does not\n+have a transaction history (meaning no its address has been used before).\n+\n+Software needs to discover all used accounts after importing the seed from\n+an external source. Such algorithm is described in \"Account discovery\" chapter.\n+\n+===Change===\n+\n+Constant 0 is used for external chain and constant 1 for internal chain (also\n+known as change addresses). External chain is used for addresses that are meant\n+to be visible outside of the wallet (e.g. for receiving payments). Internal\n+chain is used for addresses which are not meant to be visible outside of the\n+wallet and is used for return transaction change.\n+\n+Public derivation is used at this level.\n+\n+===Index===\n+\n+Addresses are numbered from index 0 in sequentially increasing manner.\n+This number is used as child index in BIP32 derivation.\n+\n+Public derivation is used at this level.\n+\n+==Account discovery==\n+\n+When the master seed is imported from an external source the software should\n+start to discover the accounts in the following manner:\n+\n+1) derive the first account's node (index = 0)\n+2) derive the external chain node of this account\n+3) scan addresses of the external chain; respect the gap limit described below\n+4) if no transactions are found on the external chain stop discovery\n+5) if there are some transactions, increase the account index and go to step 1\n+",
