    "body": "This fixes the current description of the P2SH-P2WPKH redeem script, which incorrectly prepends 0x16 to the script. This contradicts the correct description in the [ Segwit Wallet Development Guide](https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_wallet_dev/#creation-of-p2sh-p2wpkh-address):\r\n\r\n> The P2SH redeemScript is always 22 bytes. It starts with a OP_0, followed by a canonical push of the keyhash (i.e. 0x0014{20-byte keyhash})\r\n\r\nThe prepended 0x16 also results in the script being a single data push: the witness mechanism is not triggered, the script evaluates to TRUE and the TX is accepted by the network with no signature, creating a potentially dangerous gotcha for wallet developers.",

This contradicts the correct description in https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_wallet_dev/:\r\n\r\n    The P2SH redeemScript is always 22 bytes. It starts with a OP_0, followed by a canonical push of the keyhash (i.e. 0x0014{20-byte keyhash})\r\n\r\nThe prepended 0x16 also results in the script being a single data push: the witness mechanism is not triggered, the script evaluates to TRUE and the TX is accepted by the network with no signature, creating a potentially dangerous gotcha for wallet developers.",

      "body": "@dabura667 Thanks for the clarification. I like your suggestion. It prevents any confusion by making it absolutely clear that the push byte doesn't belong to the redeem script. How to go about submitting this as a patch? Close this pull request and open a new one?\r\n\r\nMy wallet uses bitcoind as a back end, so I didn't have to craft the scriptSig, only the redeem script. That's what got me into trouble. Who knows, there might be other front-end wallets out there whose devs could fall into the same trap.",
