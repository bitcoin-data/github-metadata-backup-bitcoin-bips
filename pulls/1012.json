    "body": "Addresses the issue with needless and reckless rejecting of BIPs solely due to time passing. Instead allow anyone to inactivate a BIP. Rejection should be done based on BIP inapplicability.\r\n\r\nThis does not retroactively undo the rejections made so far.\r\n\r\nSee #1006 discussion for details.\r\n\r\nNote: I didn't realize there was an .svg source for the process.png file, so I rewrote the thing from scratch in latex. The .tex file is added in this commit. If people prefer, I will try to rewrite in the .svg format, but I put some effort into it so please compare the tex version first.\r\n\r\nTodo:\r\n* [ ] Update svg; remove tex stuff.",

You haven't deleted references to \"Rejected\" status.\r\n\r\n> the Rejected status is hereby obsolete. ([comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1012#issue-502159867))\r\n\r\nPersonally I think we still need a Rejected status. It just isn't applied in the case when a BIP becomes \"Inactive\" due to 3 years of inactivity.\r\n\r\nThere is also the the process path [diagram](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002/process.png) to consider. I don't think Inactive would need to be incorporated into this because presumably the BIP could become Inactive at any stage in the process.",

The above is the current wording. If a draft BIP becomes Rejected/Inactive due to 3 years of inactivity it has to \"address public criticism of the proposal\" to change status. But what if there was literally no public criticism, it entirely became Rejected/Inactive due to 3 years of inactivity? The draft BIP author has to find public criticism to address that may not have been present.\r\n\r\nI also agree with @MarcoFalke that a new BIP for such a minor change is overkill.\r\n",

I think what is needed here is essentially a copy-editign change.   Proposals sometimes are actually rejected. in so much as something ever can be, but in many cases its really subjective if a proposal was actually rejected vs just set aside until its positives outweighed the negatives.  The term invites time wasting debate on a criteria that no one needs to determine, because what matters more often to people isn't if it's rejected but if it's a live proposal that they need to pay attention to. I think \"rejected\" was intended to and has, in practice, encompassed that meaning-- but it's also clearly caused some amount of unnecessary dispute.\r\n\r\nIt would also be useful to people to know that something has been truly \"rejected\"-- so they would be discouraged from submitting quasi-duplicates-- but I think in a highly open process there just isn't an unambiguous enough signal that you can usually mark bips with a clear cut criteria.  ... A lot of the purpose of forcing all BIPs into mailling list proposal is to get authors to give up on proposals that don't stand a chance fast, so most things which could unambiguously receive a reject already don't make it as far as getting numbers and what does is at least debatable as to why it is currently failing to get traction.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I don't personally see a problem with making small changes to active bips that don't \"break compatibility\".  Some tweak of language here is probably fine.\r\n",

Hence I think it is better to not include ACTIVE in FINAL/ACTIVE as I think it adds confusion. \r\n\r\nMaybe worth getting @harding to look over this. I don't want this causing confusion later on down the line. And as I've previously said this BIP should generally remain unchanged.",

      "body": "> Maybe worth getting @harding to look over this. I don't want this causing confusion later on down the line.\r\n\r\nThe sentence being edited was already hard to understand due to excess commas; now it's a little harder to understand.  However, if if the goal is making a minimal edit, I think this is ok-ish.\r\n\r\nHowever, having read the discussion in #1006, I'm not convinced this PR fully addresses the issue.  I don't get the impression from @maaku's comments that he'd consider BIP98 \"inactive\" (but I hope he will comment here if I'm inferring incorrectly).  It was my understanding that the BIP2 `Comments-Summary` field was meant to capture information about the community response to particular proposals; is there some reason we can't use that?  For example, someone could post something like:\r\n\r\n> Three years after the introduction of BIP98, it hasn't seen any significant changes, isn't used in any currently widely discussed consensus proposals, and isn't part of any widely used Bitcoin network protocol.  It may become a useful part of future proposals (or earlier proposals that see renewed interest) but there is currently no direct benefit to implementing it in Bitcoin software.\r\n\r\nThen the Comments-Summary could be updated to: \"Not in current use or part of any active proposal\".  I think this should satisfy the concern about developers spending their limited time reading and maybe implementing BIPs like BIP98 which don't currently provide significant benefits.\r\n\r\nWith regard to BIP2, the change could then be that proposals shouldn't be rejected unless it's clear they should never be implemented in their current form, e.g. they contain a security vulnerability.",

      "body": "@harding, you are correct. This change of this PR is a bit of a tangent from the discussion that started in #1006.\r\n\r\nI knew about the rule that any 3rd party can act to reject a BIP after 3 years of apparent inactivity. I had always understood this to be a process for dealing with abandoned BIPs, and to be used only when there was justifiable reason, like an unhandled security vulnerability. After all, the wording is that someone has to advocate for the rejection of a BIP; it's not a state transition that happens automatically. In #1006 (and #1007, #1008, and many others when I then looked at this repo's merge history) I was surprised to find that for some months now BIPs in Draft status have been routinely closed upon going 3 years without an update, with or without a stated reason.\r\n\r\nI do not think that there should be an automatic transition of a BIP's status based on nothing more than the passage of time. Changing that final state to \"Inactive\" instead of \"Rejected\" just softens the wording of something that shouldn't happen regardless.\r\n\r\n> Then the Comments-Summary could be updated to: \"Not in current use or part of any active proposal\". I think this should satisfy the concern about developers spending their limited time reading and maybe implementing BIPs like BIP98 which don't currently provide significant benefits.\r\n\r\nThis discussion belongs in #1006, but BIP-98 is in current use and part of an active proposal.\r\n\r\n> With regard to BIP2, the change could then be that proposals shouldn't be rejected unless it's clear they should never be implemented in their current form, e.g. they contain a security vulnerability.\r\n\r\nI would much prefer this approach.",
