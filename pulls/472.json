Sizes outside of this range are disallowed.\"\n\nAnd perhaps @prusnak could clarify whether,  within that range,  if `[128, 160, 192, 224, 256]` are the only suitable options or not.\n\nSince, as is,  all we have is:\n\n> The following table describes the relation between the initial entropy\n>   length (ENT), the checksum length (CS) and the length of the generated mnemonic         length \n\nWhich is by no means a specification of valid sizes,  nor even a _recommendation_.\n",

Changing a recommendation to a hard restriction so long after the fact is wrong.\n\nIf this was a new BIP, and problems come to light in the implementation phase, these kind of changes can be considered. But this one has been in this state for years.\n\nThe correct way to handle this would be to define a new BIP that adds the restriction.\n\n(Also as there is an effective hard limit of 8192 bits after which the algorithm breaks down, it would IMO be better to just add that as #471 did)\n",

Our intention was clearly to use 128-256 range; obviously missing the check for this is also our mistake. We even did not consider to use more entropy, as you can see there's limit of calculating checksum, which wasn't known before. Also, our motivation was wallet interoperability and although libraries does not handle the limit (yet), I assume many UIs and applications allow only 12-24 words to be used, like TREZOR does.\n\nAlso we don't think there's any real usecase for such huge mnemonics, because - as Stick stated well - people may have troubles to write even 24 words correctly. Using longer mnemonics is actually less fault-proof.\n\nI see that as our mistake in specs, which should be fixed before bigger damage will happen. People may started asking \"why some wallets generate only 24 words, when others have longer and more secure seeds? I want one, too!\". So I appreciate the finding, maybe I would use more diplomatic wording in discussion, but I agree with this PR.\n",
