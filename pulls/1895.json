Think of it as a theft from everyone.\" \r\n\r\n> Think of it as a theft from everyone\r\n\r\nNot necessarily. Operating quantum computers costs a lot. For example no one will run computations if it costs 100M to break 50M worth UTXO. Of course with technological and algorithmic improvements the cost of breaking a key will go down. \r\n\r\nBut as costs go down each quantum-computer owner is faced with dillema, they:\r\n1) either hack the UTXO ASAP pocketing the small difference between value-of-UTXO and cost-to-break-it\r\n2) or wait for further advancement to increase margin profit\r\n\r\nDue to game-theory we can expect quantum-computer-owners to go for option 1. They won't go for option 2, because they don't know if other players will also go for option 2. It introduces race-to-the-bottom dynamics between competing players in which cost-to-break-UTXO approaches value-of-the-UTXO.\r\n\r\nDoes it seem similar to something? Yeah, bitcoin mining in which average-cost-to-mine-one-bitcoin approaches value-of-one-bitcoin.\r\n\r\nQuantum UTXO hacking can be framed as another parallel process of proof-of-work mining, but with the quantum-computers instead of SHA hashing chips. And as such I don't think it is something to deem negative.",

      "body": "I'd be interested an expanded rationale for the approach of rejecting transactions that rely on ECDSA/Schnorr keys vs freezing quantum vulnerable outputs.\n\n> Bitcoin's current signatures (ECDSA/Schnorr) will be a tantalizing target: any UTXO that has ever exposed its public key on-chain (roughly 25 % of all bitcoin) could be stolen by a cryptographically relevant quantum computer.\n\nThe approach you propose would definitely prevent more thief long term. What is the delta between this and freezing all quantum vulnerable outputs in terms of vulnerable bitcoins?\n\nIs the mechanism to determine if a transaction is reject, if OP_CHECKSIG appears in the script?\n\nIf someone did a Schnorr CHECKSIG and a PQ signature CHECKSIG_ML, would that be rejected? Probably right, that would be the more simple check.",
