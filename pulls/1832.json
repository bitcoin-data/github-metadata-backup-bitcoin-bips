The Specification section seems like a good starting point for a conversation on the mailing list about the approach. It would be preferable if the proposal had seen more discussion and the document were further developed before being submitted here. We recommend that authors iterate on a pull request against their own fork of the BIPs repository at the early sketch stage as it doesn’t make sense to bombard other subscribers of this repository with notifications while the proposal is just starting to take shape.\r\n\r\nI’m going to turn this into a draft pull request, but I would recommend that it be closed and reopened at a later time when the proposal is fleshed out more.\r\n\r\nAlso, please look into why your commit is labeled as having been authored by Janus—that’s just weird.",

      "body": "Because the details aren't specified, it's not quite clear how this would differ from BIP-360. As Murch mentioned, it would make sense to at least contrast this with that BIP. There seems to be some overlap, and the parts that don't overlap, such as PQC KEM, might be better specified as a separate BIP. If I were to make a suggestion, maybe this BIP could focus on Group 2 algorithms (for communication between nodes and wallets, as the pqc-bitcoin readme states) and BIP-360 would cover Group 1. Do you think that might make sense?",

So, what you're saying take Group 1 out as it covered in your BIP-360 and just foucs on Group 2 algorithms for communications between nodes, and wallets.  It makes sense but let me tell the following:\n\n1.  Main objective of pqcBitcoin was a holistic implementation pqc repo.\n\n2.  If we go this suggestion, we need to know how to integrate your BIP-360 (seems Group 1) and Group 2.",

It integrates cryptographic primitives that are resistant to quantum computing-based attacks.\n+\n+### Proposed Algorithm\n+- **Algorithm Choice**: The proposal suggests utilizing lattice-based algorithms such as **Kyber** for key exchange and **NTRU** for signatures as post-quantum alternatives to the traditional ECDSA and ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman).\n+- **Integration with Bitcoin**: This proposal does not aim to replace Bitcoin’s existing cryptography but to introduce hybrid solutions, where PQC algorithms are used alongside traditional ones, offering a gradual transition period.\n+- **Quantum-Safe Key Management**: The proposal suggests leveraging a hybrid approach where users can generate Bitcoin addresses using PQC methods, alongside existing methods for backward compatibility during the transition period.\n+\n+### Implementation in Bitcoin\n+- **Key Changes to Bitcoin**: \n+  - Replace existing signature verification with the PQC signature scheme.\n+  - Introduce a flag to indicate whether a transaction is using the post-quantum secure method.\n+  - Ensure backward compatibility by maintaining ECDSA signatures for users who don’t implement the PQC methods.\n+\n+### Transition Plan\n+- **Phased Rollout**: The implementation of PQC can be rolled out in phases, with soft forks to accommodate the transition.\n+- **Backward Compatibility**: Bitcoin will continue to accept ECDSA signatures while supporting the new PQC signatures. This ensures that the network can maintain functionality while gradually migrating towards quantum-resistant cryptographic techniques.\n+\n+== Reference Implementation ==\n+The reference implementation of pqcBitcoin can be found at the following GitHub repository: [pqcBitcoin Reference Implementation](https://github.com/QBlockQ/pqc-bitcoin).\n+\n+The implementation includes the following:\n+- A **PQC-enabled wallet** that supports generating quantum-safe addresses and signing transactions using NTRU-based signatures.\n+- A **modified Bitcoin node** that validates both ECDSA and PQC signatures, ensuring compatibility with both old and new addresses during the transition period.\n+- **Test vectors** that demonstrate the functionality and security of the proposed cryptographic methods when applied to Bitcoin transactions.\n+\n+== Rationale ==",
