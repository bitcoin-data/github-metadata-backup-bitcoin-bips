One should be removed, honestly mine since it care after, but I would hate to see this discussion end without a resolution.\n\nCould we go ahead and change all the statuses in the README for BIPs for which there are no disputes? I think that covers most BIPs except for BIP72 at this point.\n\nIt would be a huge boon to the ecosystem if people could look at the BIPs README, look at all the Final BIPs, without reading through extensive discussions, and just focus on implementing them. Would move the protocol faster and make bitcoin stronger.\n",

      "body": "@voisine It makes sense but that'd make it harder to find a BIP, at least programmatically. There are some scripts that automatically link to a BIP given the number.\n\nBut I like the idea to decentralize the responsibility of reviewing and merging changes to BIPs.\n\nMaybe we could roll something that authors submit a GPG key, and that for each BIP we have a list of author keys, and that commits signed by one of the authors to their BIP are automatically merged. Or alternatively we could forego the GPG signing and base it in github account.\n\nThis would assume that the authors are responsible enough to respect their BIP status - that they won't make technical changes after the BIP is Final. Then again, reverting is always possible. It's better than having _everything_ go through the bottleneck of the Bitcoin Core team (which makes little sense in the first place)...\n",
