    "body": "# BIP-85 Passwords\r\n\r\nApplication number 707764' was chosen as follows:\r\n`b\"pwd\"` --> `[112, 119, 100]` ---to hex--> `707764` + make it hardened --> `707764'`\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\nHaving ability to generate countless number of strong passwords from one seed (one seed to rule them all). Main intention is to generate very strong passwords for sensitive applications like encrypting of ssh keys, master password for password managers etc. Passwords are constrained by length. Min. 20 character and max. 86 character. Generated passwords have at least 120 and maximum of 516 bits of entropy. This is provably overkill for applications like Gmail or twitter but is not the intended use case anyway.\r\n\r\nPasswords are generated by encoding whole 64 bytes of  generated entropy and removing any spaces or new lines inserted by Base64 encoding process. Slice base64 result string\r\non index 0 to `pwd_len`. This slice is the resulting password. As `pwd_len` is limited to 86, passwords will not contain padding.\r\n\r\nBase64 is a great and well known candidate for password use case as it contains both lower/upper case characters, numbers and special characters `+` and `/`.\r\n\r\n## Constraints\r\n* `pwd_length` min. 20 max. 86\r\n\r\n## Changes:\r\n* fix typo in XPRV\r\n* fix formatting in other implementations\r\n* new application = passwords\r\n\r\n## Implementations:\r\n* already implemented in [btc-hd-wallet](https://github.com/scgbckbone/btc-hd-wallet)\r\n* opened [PR](https://github.com/ethankosakovsky/bip85/pull/16) in reference implementation\r\n* opened [PR](https://github.com/Coldcard/firmware/pull/127) to Coldcard firmware (merged in https://github.com/Coldcard/firmware/commit/26986cfc852116922d36708cbc3ea63d6f883aa4)\r\n\r\n",

In general, we'd like to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred BIP, but that's really up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the BIP process, or has fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the direction of the BIP. We try to build consensus around a BIP, but if that's not possible, you can always submit a competing BIP.\r\n>\r\n>**If you are interested in assuming ownership of a BIP, send a message asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the BIP editors.** If the original author doesn't respond to email in a timely manner, the BIP editors will make a unilateral decision (it's not like such decisions can't be reversed :).\r\n",

      "body": "> I would like to keep length requirements same as for hex 16-64 as I want this to generate strong passwords - on par with bitcoin security (min. cca 128bits) --> now I'm not sure if it is good idea to start generating passwords as your bank requires, between 40 -65bits of entropy, which seems to be low (on top for financial applications). Yet I know that there are lots of apps with \"strange\" password requirements out there. Thoughts ?\r\n\r\nI love the concept in general but the problem is there are a lot of strange password policies being enforced. Many don't calculate entropy correctly - for example, a long password a-zA-Z0-9 being considered unacceptable regardless of the  because of no symbols. I have seen website enforcing upper, lower, numerals, and symbols and must be a specific length. So even with a 25 character password of a-zA-Z0-9.\r\n\r\nWould I be correct in assuming there no guarantee a password generated under this proposed method would be acceptable by all websites? How do you handle cases where password change policy is in effect forcing you to change your password every 90 days or whatever. Or if for any reason (like a breach) the website forces a password reset on everyone.\r\n\r\nI think it's a pity we're only generating passwords according to the base64 alphabet. It would seem more appropriate to use hex 0x20 (or maybe 0x21) until 0x7e which is the full range of ASCII roman letters, numerals and basic symbols. It would achieve a lot more entropy for shorter passwords as well.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I would like to comment that I think the speed at which you're proposing and implementing does not really allow for community input. From opening the PR to already having it implemented in 3rd party systems was just a matter of days. For the record, I felt extremely pressured in the beginning of BIP85 proposal. While it was wonderful to have the enthusiasm for the idea, some aspects were rushed in trying to avoid a split proposal/implementation (i.e. implemented differently in Coldcard vs the BIP). It really does take time to consider the cases, and for community input. I think there needs to be more evangelizing of the proposal to garner feedback - surely there are things that others might consider that we didn't. While BIP85 deliberated avoided inventing new cryptography by seeking to repurpose existing proven technology, the implementation and usecases could have done with a bit more polishing.\r\n\r\nBack to the proposal, there are other problems, in that some sites enforce restrictions on password length. This proposal really falls a bit short on these numerous cases. I also wonder if  there shouldn't really be some form of salt involved, using the domain name as a DN of sorts. This might allow iterating when password changes are forced or required due to a breach on the provider's side.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "My concern about this proposal is the fact that BIP85 master seed is a highly-valuable information which has to be kept in the most secure way (since it assumed to derive all the rest seeds eveywhere). On the other hand, creating new passwords is a daily thing, and since it uses private key entropy it would require to keep the whole BIP85 seed as a hot wallet!\r\n\r\nSo my proposal is to have a BP85 path to derive another \"BIPXXX\" seed, which must not be used for anything else than passwords derivation (according to the proposed specification in this PR) - and put it as an independent BIP. In this case we can easily keep the specific xpriv as a hot wallet, since it would not compromise anything else than a set of password.",
