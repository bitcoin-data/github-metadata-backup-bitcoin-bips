Others have been confused as well:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/ACINQ/phoenix/issues/588\r\n\r\nThis PR reorders the sentences and slightly rewords them.\r\n\r\nBecause the rationale comes _after_ these instructions, it's important to first point out the main aim: `₿user@example.com` should be the default rendering, it's not just some optional alternative format.\r\n\r\nI moved the bit about external (hardware) wallets down.\r\n\r\nI'm unconvinced the ₿-prefix is a good idea in the first place, but this PR doesn't change it.",
