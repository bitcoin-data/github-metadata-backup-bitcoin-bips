We couldn't verify the checksum.\" and if you say yes it generates the wallet.\r\n\r\nIf every wallet did it this way, then Japanese phrases could be recovered easily on any wallet.\r\n\r\nBut because the BIP is at odds with itself (it specifies a checksum, which in traditional dev work is always a \"hard fail\", but says \"issue a warning\"... and yet everyone \"hard fails\" and prevents recovery if unknown wordlist / phrase, technically not following spec.) we've come to a turning point where \"the BIP39 everyone follows\" and \"the BIP39 document\" are two different standards.\r\n\r\nI suggest we fork BIP39, BIP39 can add breaking changes to say \"must hard fail\" and \"English only\" and we split the current BIP39 document (with added emphasis to the \"any wordlist should be recoverable in any app, but the wordlists you know have an added benefit of being able to check a checksum\" so that people know the difference) off into another BIP.",

Special Polish characters like 'ą', 'ę', 'ć', etc... are considered equal to 'a', 'e', 'c', etc... in terms of identifying a word. Therefore, there is no need to use a Polish keyboard to introduce the passphrase, an application with the Polish wordlist will be able to identify the words after the first 4 chars have been typed even if the chars with accents have been replaced with the equivalent without accents.\r\n4. All words are in basic form.\r\n5. No personal names or geographical names.\r\n6. No very similar words with 2 letter of difference.\r\n7. Words are sorted according English alphabet ignoring diacritic signs.\r\n8. No words already used in other language mnemonic sets (english, italian, french, spanish, czech).\r\n9. Built with the most popular Polish words based on the [Open frequency dictionary of lexems](https://web.archive.org/web/20091116122442/http://www.open-dictionaries.com/slownikfrleks.pdf)\r\n10. Words include negative and bad things as those are easier to remember.\r\n\r\nUnlike #753 it this wordlist is based on popular words dictionary and does not include any words used in other language mnemonic sets. It differs also by using polish symbols. Please consider merging it.",

For the rest that do, it's not easy to implement the new BIP alongside the first one, otherwise they're basically offering an option to accept a seed that may be localized, and an option to accept a seed with the requirement that it's English-only. Having both of these displayed at the same time, for example at Electrum's or Mycelium's seed recovery prompt, will confuse many wallet software users, removing support for the old BIP in favor of the new one will break everyone's localized seeds and doing nothing and continuing to use the old BIP doesn't improve the situation around checksums and localized wordlists. This is why I also think the deprecation text in the PR is the best course of action. \r\n\r\nThen at least newer wallets that are made will hopefully take English-only seeds that enforce the checksum consistently rule.\r\n\r\nI think Electrum's seed version system has a bright future though, and I hope more wallets use it and that a system is devised around it that lets people submit arbitrary wordlists to Electrum's list of wordlists.",
