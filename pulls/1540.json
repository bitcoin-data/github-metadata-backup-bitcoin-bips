      "body": "> I had a discussion involving @jonasnick and @sipa about this. Since BIP 327 suggests to do sorting, we decided it made sense to do in descriptors as well.\r\n\r\nBIP 327 discusses the possibility of sorting and describes a canonical sorting, but I didn't read it as 'suggesting' one way or another.\r\n\r\nIn general, I'd prefer maximum simplicity and less chances of malleability in descriptors, and this imho goes against both (albeit slightly, not a huge deal).\r\n\r\nNote that this removes functionality, as one of $n! - 1$ of the $n!$ possible combinations become inexpressible with descriptors.",

The language in this document feels a bit roundabout. Some parts of the Motivation that describe alternative designs would better fit the Rationale section. I would generally recommend the use of active voice in a specification document. It would be great if at least a first test vectors could be added.\r\n\r\nI would recommend to split this PR to make each BIP a separate pull request.",

However, as the best practice is to use a new address for every payment,\n+it is necessary for the cosigners of a single aggregate pubkey to have a way to produce additional\n+aggregate pubkeys.\n+\n+The obvious method is for the cosigners to generate multiple public keys and produce a\n+new aggregate pubkey every time one is needed. This is similar to how multisig using Bitcoin script\n+works where all of the cosigners share their extended public keys and do derivation to produce\n+the multisig script. The same could be done with MuSig2 and instead of producing a multisig script,\n+the result would be a MuSig2 aggregate pubkey.\n+\n+However, it is much simpler to be able to derive from a single extended public key instead of having\n+to derive from many extended public keys and aggregate them. As MuSig2 produces a normal looking\n+public key, the aggregate public can be used in this way. This reduces the storage and computation\n+requirements for generating new aggregate pubkeys.",

However, as the best practice is to use a new address for every payment,\n+it is necessary for the cosigners of a single aggregate pubkey to have a way to produce additional\n+aggregate pubkeys.\n+\n+The obvious method is for the cosigners to generate multiple public keys and produce a\n+new aggregate pubkey every time one is needed. This is similar to how multisig using Bitcoin script\n+works where all of the cosigners share their extended public keys and do derivation to produce\n+the multisig script. The same could be done with MuSig2 and instead of producing a multisig script,\n+the result would be a MuSig2 aggregate pubkey.\n+\n+However, it is much simpler to be able to derive from a single extended public key instead of having\n+to derive from many extended public keys and aggregate them. As MuSig2 produces a normal looking\n+public key, the aggregate public can be used in this way. This reduces the storage and computation\n+requirements for generating new aggregate pubkeys.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+A synthetic xpub can be created from a BIP 327 MuSig2 plain aggregate public key by setting\n+the depth to 0, the child number to 0, and attaching a chaincode with the byte string\n+<tt>868087ca02a6f974c4598924c36b57762d32cb45717167e300622c7167e38965</tt><ref>'''Where does this\n+constant chaincode come from?''' It is the SHA256 of the text <tt>MuSig2MuSig2MuSig2</tt></ref>.\n+This fixed chaincode should be used by all such synthetic xpubs following this specification.\n+Unhardend child public keys can be derived from the synthetic xpub as with any other xpub.",

The same could be done with MuSig2 and instead of producing a multisig script,\n+the result would be a MuSig2 aggregate pubkey.\n+\n+However, it is much simpler to be able to derive from a single extended public key instead of having\n+to derive from many extended public keys and aggregate them. As MuSig2 produces a normal looking\n+public key, the aggregate public can be used in this way. This reduces the storage and computation\n+requirements for generating new aggregate pubkeys.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+A synthetic xpub can be created from a BIP 327 MuSig2 plain aggregate public key by setting\n+the depth to 0, the child number to 0, and attaching a chaincode with the byte string\n+<tt>868087ca02a6f974c4598924c36b57762d32cb45717167e300622c7167e38965</tt><ref>'''Where does this\n+constant chaincode come from?''' It is the SHA256 of the text <tt>MuSig2MuSig2MuSig2</tt></ref>.\n+This fixed chaincode should be used by all such synthetic xpubs following this specification.\n+Unhardend child public keys can be derived from the synthetic xpub as with any other xpub.",

      "body": "After talking about this again with @sipa, the conclusion is that philosophically, MuSig2 operates over a set of keys, so the order should not matter. For serialization as an implementation detail, it does, so having it sorted is a logical order for an ostensibly unordered set.\r\n\r\nAnother argument for sorting is to make the recovery process easier,. As we know from multisig usage that exists currently, users are often surprised to learn that they had to know more than just their key and their cosigners. By sorting, we can eliminate this as a concern. Ostensibly, users should be backing up their descriptors, but in practice, especially with the prevalance of hardware signers which espouse that only the seed needs to be backed up, I don't think that's something that happens that often.",

Furthermore, PSBT_IN_TAP_BIP32_DERIVATION fields include fingerprints\n+to identify master keys, and these fingerprints require full compressed public keys. By including\n+the aggregate key as a full public key, signers that are unaware of the MuSig2 outside of the PSBT\n+will still be able to identify which keys are derived from the aggregate key by computing and then\n+comparing the fingerprints.

These will be fields for\n+the participants' keys, the public nonces, and the partial signatures produced with MuSig2.\n+\n+===Copyright===\n+\n+This BIP is licensed under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license.\n+\n+===Motivation===\n+\n+BIP 327 specifies a way to create BIP 340 compatible public keys and signatures using the MuSig2\n+Multi-Signature scheme. The existing PSBT fields are unable to support MuSig2 as it introduces new\n+concepts and additional rounds of communication. Therefore new fields must be defined to allow PSBTs\n+to carry the information necessary to produce a valid signature with MuSig2.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+The new per-input types are defined as follows:\n+\n+{|\n+!

Aggregate public keys are expected to be\n+derived from, following [[bip-musig2-derivation.mediawiki|BIP-musig2-derivation]], and therefore will\n+need to include the evenness. Furthermore, PSBT_IN_TAP_BIP32_DERIVATION fields include fingerprints\n+to identify master keys, and these fingerprints require full compressed public keys. By including\n+the aggregate key as a full public key, signers that are unaware of the MuSig2 outside of the PSBT\n+will still be able to identify which keys are derived from the aggregate key by computing and then\n+comparing the fingerprints. This is necessary for the signer to apply the correct tweaks to their\n+partial signature.</ref> from the <tt>KeyAgg</tt> algorithm. This key may or may not\n+be in the script directly (as x-only).
