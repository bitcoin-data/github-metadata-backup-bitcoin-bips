    "body": "Ordinal numbers are serial numbers for sats, assigned when mined and preserved across transactions.\r\n\r\nI originally posted an earlier draft of the BIP to [bitcoin-dev](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-February/019975.html) in February of last year.\r\n\r\nWe've implemented a wallet and block explorer, with public instances on [mainnet](http://ordinals.com/), [signet](http://signet.ordinals.com/), and [testnet](https://testnet.ordinals.com), and a [wallet](https://github.com/casey/ord) that uses sat control to ensure specific sats are transferred to specific outputs. Constructing such transactions is tricky, especially given the dust limit and doing proper fee estimation, but once you get the details right it works well, and the fact that such transactions are otherwise normal Bitcoin transactions means that existing bitcoin infrastructure can be leveraged.\r\n\r\nSince we've been using ordinal numbers in production and getting some users of the software it seemed appropriate to request a BIP number.\r\n\r\nI've never applied for a BIP number before, so definitely let me know if anything should be changed or can be improved!",

It's fun, and also suggests that it's way off in the stratosphere, away from the other, more serious BIPs. Also, having a larger number than the 300 series might signal nicely to those concerned that it's a worse idea than Drivechain.",

      "body": "> for data storage (which was not an intended use case, and any ways to do that were limited, like OP_RETURN being capped at 80 bytes)\r\n\r\n@Semisol  It was not actually limited in practice, since customers of miners' blockspace have been storing arbitrary data in Bitcoin via p2ms regardless, due to the lack of OP_RETURN flexibility, which was worse for Bitcoin than OP_RETURN (occupied nodes' RAM), yet done anyway because \"you cannot stop the free market\"; if you try, you will end up with sub-optimal outcomes and an inefficient market. Inscriptions is better than the real alternative of p2ms, and so is an improvement even in just this simple way to Bitcoin's functioning.\r\n\r\nArbitrary data (with its inherent mix of pros and cons) has been stored in Bitcoin throughout its history, prior to Inscriptions, so Inscriptions is really nothing new:\r\n\r\n1. http://www.righto.com/2014/02/ascii-bernanke-wikileaks-photographs.html\r\n2. https://ourbigbook.com/cirosantilli/cool-data-embedded-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain\r\n3. https://fc18.ifca.ai/preproceedings/6.pdf\r\n\r\n> It's not something a subset of people \"don't like\" -- it is misuse of the network, which was meant for financial transactions (the whitepaper, name and code point to this)\r\n\r\n@Semisol  However, it is exactly about what people do not like, and it is exactly not a misuse of the network.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the market demand (fee market is competitive, fee rate determines priority; if the non-financial tx with higher fee rate outcompetes the financial tx with lower fee rate, then this is the free market speaking about where real economic value lies, as an example) is what actually determines for which use the miners sell their finite blockspace to their customers (those paying for transactions) -- and is what determines good/desirable vs. bad/undesirable/spam/nonsense/stupid/etc. The individual opinion of someone is not what determines which uses are valid or invalid, as of course it is the miners who \"own\" that blockspace, so it is only the miners who make that determination (and if users for example try to stop nodes from relaying certain transactions to miners, ahem, it only incentivizes miners to create alternative channels for users to directly send transactions to miners, which as you may imagine creates all kinds of unintended consequences that are bad for Bitcoin -- you must remember the bottom line realities of the network, upon which the unstoppable free market operates, in order to avoid making mistakes that make what is seen as a problem become even worse).\r\n\r\nMiners are incentivized to increase their total revenue per block, as a course of normal business, and also as they try to offset their exponentially-declining subsidy revenue (which is meant to be replaced with fee revenue, hence the name 'subsidy'). As such, miners do not care to pass moral or any other such judgement to choose to censor technically-valid bitcoin transactions (and since Bitcoin is supposed to be a censorship-resistant network, we would hope so!).\r\n\r\nAt best, Bitcoin is designed so that miners simply behave as rational economic actors, which means they should be optimizing their fee revenue, which in turn is good for Bitcoin as it encourages censorship-resistance, and also increases Bitcoin's \"security budget\" (relevant when considering Bitcoin inherently exists in an adversarial environment in which hostile hashrate must be assumed to exist) -- by encouraging higher-fee transactions that are economically meaningful on the base layer (this is what determines 'value', not any moral or other judgment).\r\n\r\nAnything that increases demand for Bitcoin's supply of blockspace, thus allowing bocks to be filled with a floor of lower fee-rate transactions to create a competitive fee-rate market, acts to boost fee-rate pressure, thus helping to increase the **fee-to-subsidy ratio of each block and improving Bitcoin's security**. Since security is the number 1 priority of any Bitcoin user, without which everything else is irrelevant, the number 1 priority should be to boost demand for blockspace.\r\n\r\nInscriptions simply popularizes another demand for blockspace (arbitrary data stored by customers desiring the best decentralized network on Earth), beyond the existing demands from SoV (store of value) and MoE (medium of exchange) (low-value high-volume MoE transactions go on second layers, high-value low-volume MoE transactions go on base layer) uses that so far have not been sufficient to reliably fill blocks & generate enough fee pressure to offset the subsidy (fee-to-subsidy ratio of 100%).\r\n\r\nInscriptions theoretically (and so far in practice, however the fee-to-subsidy ratio of each blocks is still only 3.5%, since this only picked up steam 2 weeks ago) achieves this boost in blockspace demand by filling blocks and increasing economic activity on the base layer (vs. the last 1.5 years that have been marred with many non-full blocks and thus paltry fees -- objectively bad from the point of view of network security), thus objectively it is not a misuse of the network, and rather it is \"good for bitcoin\" for anyone who cares about Bitcoin's security and security sustainability (vis a vis the hashrate sustaining itself without the exponentially-declining subsidy), and who is able and willing to truly appreciate what a censorship-resistant network requires to function successfully in an adversarial environment. Really, it is a matter of being focused on priorities, so that the number 1 priority of security and security sustainability is able to rise in your mind to the top of consideration (over lesser considerations of judging uses as 'good' vs. 'bad'/'nonsense'/'spam').\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I have not used Inscriptions nor do I intend to use it anytime soon, so I am not speaking in my own interest, I am only speaking in the interest of Bitcoin.",

It does not make sense to not accept sats on basis of rarity labeling, so it doesn’t hurt fungibility.\r\n\r\nIt’s like fiat coins, which can all be judged numismatically on such a scale of “rarest” to “unrarest”. This aspect does not hurt fungibility of the coins, and it only potentially helps you with more value for the coins if you recognize the numismatic value of the coins.\r\n\r\nSo, Ordinals (system of having sats of different rarities) does not hurt you, only potentially helps you.\r\n\r\nNote: Ordinals and Inscriptions are two different things.

Let's get back to the issue under discussion: Should this PR be assigned a BIP?\r\n\r\nReferring to BIP-2 (BIP process, revised), it is stated that the idea should first be submitted to the dev mailing list for discussion and public vetting. The author of this PR did submit a draft BIP on Feb 23 2022, but it garnered very little discussion. In fact, of the two devs who bothered to respond, one gave it an ACK and the other a NACK. This hardly qualifies as a discussion or vetting, and most certainly **not** a community consensus. \r\n\r\nSo instead of the author seeking further discussion or community feedback before opening a PR here, we find ordinals suddenly **live** on the mainnet around the same time that this PR is opened. That is literally not what the BIP workflow is about. This is akin to zero-day behavior.\r\n\r\nIf the author chooses not respect BIP guidelines and processes, why bother seeking a BIP number here? \r\n\r\nAssigning this PR a BIP number would send to the community a strong signal that BIP-2 is no longer relevant. \r\n\r\nHard NACK on BIP number assignment.\r\n\r\n",

I would not be surprised if most of the reviewers have not read other BIPs that are already maintained in this repository. I would not blame anyone though as initially I was also not sure and wanted to avoid this controversy so suggested it being maintained elsewhere like a few other proposals used in bitcoin projects. I agree with @apoelstra and ACKed it with some suggestions in review.\r\n\r\nAlthough I do not understand what exactly would reviewers achieve by NACKing and not getting this merged as one of the [reviewer](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1408#issuecomment-1431253990) mentioned ordinals can work without this BIP. Maybe reasons are political or gain some twitter points?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Inscriptions is better than the real alternative of p2ms, and so is an improvement even in just this simple way to Bitcoin's functioning.\r\n> \r\n> Arbitrary data (with its inherent mix of pros and cons) has been stored in Bitcoin throughout its history, prior to Inscriptions, so Inscriptions is really nothing new:\r\n> \r\n> 1. http://www.righto.com/2014/02/ascii-bernanke-wikileaks-photographs.html\r\n> 2. https://ourbigbook.com/cirosantilli/cool-data-embedded-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain\r\n> 3. https://fc18.ifca.ai/preproceedings/6.pdf\r\n> \r\n> > It's not something a subset of people \"don't like\" -- it is misuse of the network, which was meant for financial transactions (the whitepaper, name and code point to this)\r\n> \r\n> @Semisol However, it is exactly about what people do not like, and it is exactly not a misuse of the network.\r\n> \r\n> In reality, the market demand (fee market is competitive, fee rate determines priority; if the non-financial tx with higher fee rate outcompetes the financial tx with lower fee rate, then this is the free market speaking about where real economic value lies, as an example) is what actually determines for which use the miners sell their finite blockspace to their customers (those paying for transactions) -- and is what determines good/desirable vs. bad/undesirable/spam/nonsense/stupid/etc. The individual opinion of someone is not what determines which uses are valid or invalid, as of course it is the miners who \"own\" that blockspace, so it is only the miners who make that determination (and if users for example try to stop nodes from relaying certain transactions to miners, ahem, it only incentivizes miners to create alternative channels for users to directly send transactions to miners, which as you may imagine creates all kinds of unintended consequences that are bad for Bitcoin -- you must remember the bottom line realities of the network, upon which the unstoppable free market operates, in order to avoid making mistakes that make what is seen as a problem become even worse).\r\n> \r\n> Miners are incentivized to increase their total revenue per block, as a course of normal business, and also as they try to offset their exponentially-declining subsidy revenue (which is meant to be replaced with fee revenue, hence the name 'subsidy'). As such, miners do not care to pass moral or any other such judgement to choose to censor technically-valid bitcoin transactions (and since Bitcoin is supposed to be a censorship-resistant network, we would hope so!).\r\n> \r\n> At best, Bitcoin is designed so that miners simply behave as rational economic actors, which means they should be optimizing their fee revenue, which in turn is good for Bitcoin as it encourages censorship-resistance, and also increases Bitcoin's \"security budget\" (relevant when considering Bitcoin inherently exists in an adversarial environment in which hostile hashrate must be assumed to exist) -- by encouraging higher-fee transactions that are economically meaningful on the base layer (this is what determines 'value', not any moral or other judgment).\r\n> \r\n> Anything that increases demand for Bitcoin's supply of blockspace, thus allowing bocks to be filled with a floor of lower fee-rate transactions to create a competitive fee-rate market, acts to boost fee-rate pressure, thus helping to increase the **fee-to-subsidy ratio of each block and improving Bitcoin's security**. Since security is the number 1 priority of any Bitcoin user, without which everything else is irrelevant, the number 1 priority should be to boost demand for blockspace.\r\n> \r\n> Inscriptions simply popularizes another demand for blockspace (arbitrary data stored by customers desiring the best decentralized network on Earth), beyond the existing demands from SoV (store of value) and MoE (medium of exchange) (low-value high-volume MoE transactions go on second layers, high-value low-volume MoE transactions go on base layer) uses that so far have not been sufficient to reliably fill blocks & generate enough fee pressure to offset the subsidy (fee-to-subsidy ratio of 100%).\r\n> \r\n> Inscriptions theoretically (and so far in practice, however the fee-to-subsidy ratio of each blocks is still only 3.5%, since this only picked up steam 2 weeks ago) achieves this boost in blockspace demand by filling blocks and increasing economic activity on the base layer (vs. the last 1.5 years that have been marred with many non-full blocks and thus paltry fees -- objectively bad from the point of view of network security), thus objectively it is not a misuse of the network, and rather it is \"good for bitcoin\" for anyone who cares about Bitcoin's security and security sustainability (vis a vis the hashrate sustaining itself without the exponentially-declining subsidy), and who is able and willing to truly appreciate what a censorship-resistant network requires to function successfully in an adversarial environment. Really, it is a matter of being focused on priorities, so that the number 1 priority of security and security sustainability is able to rise in your mind to the top of consideration (over lesser considerations of judging uses as 'good' vs. 'bad'/'nonsense'/'spam').\r\n> \r\n> Disclaimer: I have not used Inscriptions nor do I intend to use it anytime soon, so I am not speaking in my own interest, I am only speaking in the interest of Bitcoin.\r\n\r\n@eragmus:\r\nSpeaking also in the interest of Bitcoin and using BIP-0002: “[…] collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Bitcoin. The BIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.“, express following concern:\r\n\r\nWhat are the economical incentives for a rational actor to run a bitcoin Full-Node (if not running as Lightning-Node for whatever reason)?\r\n\r\nThis actor/role in the bitcoin network provides storage resource and verification processing (energy/time) mostly for free. If such kind of rational actors do not agree to provide storage for non-financial-transaction-bits (since once the e.g. 1 TB SSD is full, these actors will not buy a SSD of bigger capacity and provide this resource to the bitcoin network) then, they will change to run a Light-Node (to participate sovereignly in the network). This rational action could have the total effect to reduce the decentralization and security of the bitcoin network.\r\nMiner-actors can finance themselves OTC over the short/middle term. Although, over the long run the network could have its time counted.\r\n\r\nIt would be in interest of all the bitcoin network’s stakeholders to take decisions/actions in consensus and strengthen the incentives of Full-Node-Runners to provide storage resource. Focusing only on the economical/financial incentives of miner-actors ceteris paribus would destabilize the storage resources allocation, centralize and insecure the network against malicious actions/actors.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, as @luke-jr proposed: the autor of this proposal is encouraged to withdraw it and abandon it entirely. The autor of this proposal is free to pursue innovations and ideas in e.g. an OIP-0001 or the likes.",

A BIP number does have a meaning as discussed many times in previous comments. You are a correct in that being assigned one doesn't imply endorsement. There is a bar that needs to be met for a BIP number to be assigned if you read BIP 2 to ensure we don't get poor quality, nonsensical BIPs. BIP numbers are also convenient in the sense that the Taproot BIPs could have been 12345, 6839482 and 378957823 rather than BIP 340, 341 and 342. ",

If it was an automatic BIP approval process, the mix of reactions wouldn't occur which, beside their value on their own, also means people wouldn't have an opportunity to learn more about the BIP and BIP process.\r\n\r\nSo, I think overall, maybe it is best to leave the process the way it is. It is messy, but the non-emotional people who understand the BIP process are still able to make the final decision (even if they, like Luke, push their personal, and IMO misguided, opinion on the BIP itself in their comments here, personal opinion which AFAIK is irrelevant to the BIP process).",

      "body": "@ChrisMartl  Thanks for your comment, replies below:\r\n\r\n> > Speaking also in the interest of Bitcoin and using BIP-0002: “[…] collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Bitcoin. The BIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.“, express following concern:\r\n> \r\n> What are the economical incentives for a rational actor to run a bitcoin Full-Node (if not running as Lightning-Node for whatever reason)?\r\n> \r\n> This actor/role in the bitcoin network provides storage resource and verification processing (energy/time) mostly for free. \r\n\r\nThere are no direct financial incentives for a rational actor to run a Bitcoin full node, if not running a lightning node, as you suggested, since then the actor wouldn't receive any payment for running the full node.\r\n\r\nHowever, the runner of the full node presumably owns bitcoin, in which case it is in the runner's indirect financial interest that the Bitcoin network works well. Part of this includes doing their part to decentralize the network, which includes running the full node. So, it can be thought of a relatively tiny investment to help support their bitcoin investment, not to mention the various non-direct and non-indirect financial interests in running the full node for their own benefit.\r\n\r\n> If such kind of rational actors do not agree to provide storage for non-financial-transaction-bits (since once the e.g. 1 TB SSD is full, these actors will not buy a SSD of bigger capacity and provide this resource to the bitcoin network) then, they will change to run a Light-Node (to participate sovereignly in the network).\r\n\r\nWhat is the reason not to upgrade the 1 TB SSD, once full? Storage cost is one of which falls in price the fastest. The storage can only increase max about 210 GB per year, no further, and we are at about 550 GB, so that means at least 2 years more. By then, prices will likely have fallen even further (in 2 years, price for an example 2 TB SSD has fallen 63% from about $440 to $160 -- [https://3cmls.co/US/B08RK2SR23](https://3cmls.co/US/B08RK2SR23), so might be $60 in another 2 years, which would be 25% cheaper than the average price of 1 TB SSD now).\r\n\r\nAnd anyway, segwit already locked in the max of about 210 GB storage increase per year, and segwit had consensus, so this should be expected and supported and assumed by a runner of a full node, irrespective of the form the txs take ('normal' txs or arbitrary data txs).\r\n\r\nPlus, arbitrary data txs have already occurred throughout Bitcoin's history via p2ms, before Inscriptions-based arbitrary data ever became a thing, so this is not actually a new phenomenon. Full node runners have always hosted arbitrary data.\r\n\r\n> This rational action could have the total effect to reduce the decentralization and security of the bitcoin network.\r\n\r\nSure, everyone makes their own decisions, so full node runners must choose too. On the other hand, there have been reports from many that demand to run full nodes has jumped dramatically (one report indicated more demand to run full nodes in a matter of weeks/months recently than in prior 5 years total), so while there may be some loss due to ideological reasons, there may also be some gain due to new users entering Bitcoin. We will have to wait to see the full net effect on full nodes.\r\n \r\n> It would be in interest of all the bitcoin network’s stakeholders to take decisions/actions in consensus \r\n\r\nOrdinals and Inscriptions do not require consensus to operate. They are not forks of any kind. \r\n\r\nOrdinals are simply an arbitrary way of thinking about sats that categories sats into different levels of \"rarity\", like with the numismatic value of fiat coins. Meanwhile, Inscriptions are technically-valid Bitcoin txs that allow arbitrary data storage. Both are enabled via a custom wallet that lets one distinguish and work with sats, functionality that is required by both.\r\n\r\n> and strengthen the incentives of Full-Node-Runners to provide storage resource.\r\n\r\nAlready discussed previously in this message, so won't repeat.\r\n\r\n> Focusing only on the economical/financial incentives of miner-actors ceteris paribus \r\n\r\nJust to be clear, the miners are critical elements of the network, in terms of the security they provide. The full nodes' contribution to security is not even in the same realm as that provided by miners. It has always been known that the miners' compensation, via subsidy, is exponentially falling every 4 years, and so it requires to be compensated for by fees (generated by txs on the base layer). This means blocks should be full to generate fee pressure and a fee market, so that high-enough-fee rate txs (economically competitive txs) become the norm on the base layer. It is very very very important to focus on incentives of miners; it is IMO the most important element of the Bitcoin network, since without security everything falls apart.\r\n\r\n> would destabilize the storage resources allocation, centralize and insecure the network against malicious actions/actors.\r\n\r\nAlready discussed previously in this message, so won't repeat. But, even encountering a net reduction of for example 5,000 full nodes out of 100,000+ full nodes does not move the needle.\r\n\r\n> In consequence, as @luke-jr proposed: the autor of this proposal is encouraged to withdraw it and abandon it entirely. The autor of this proposal is free to pursue innovations and ideas in e.g. an OIP-0001 or the likes.\r\n\r\nWithdrawing the proposal would achieve nothing materially positive; it would only maybe negatively affect the situation, since it could make it harder to improve the proposal, and maybe make it harder to have a single source of truth re: the proposal.\r\n\r\nAbandoning it would do nothing to change the operation of it, either. This development is an example of Bitcoin's permissionless innovation characteristic: it's already released into the wild, so now the free market has taken over and will decide to what degree Ordinals & Inscriptions gain traction.\r\n\r\nBased on comments by experts of the BIP process (not the people who have used their comments and emojis to indicate disapproval of the BIP itself), including Luke himself, this BIP is legitimate and lacks any good reason not to be accepted.\r\n\r\nI hope my message has helped clarify why, on the aspect of financial incentive for full node runners and possible incentive of Inscriptions to reduce full nodes, the situation is not so clearly negative as may first be imagined.",

Part of this includes doing their part to decentralize the network, which includes running the full node. So, it can be thought of a relatively tiny investment to help support their bitcoin investment, not to mention the various non-direct and non-indirect financial interests in running the full node for their own benefit.\r\n>\r\nA node runner will reach his/her own interest participating in the bitcoin network running a Light-Node (pruned bitcoin node), since this one actor will try to profit from the decentralization achieved by other Full-Node-Runners without spending in a storage device with bigger capacity. Since this actor/role would be not motivated anymore to support the network decentralization based on ideological motives (giving storage resource for free only for financial-transactional-bits) would act probably only pursuing his/her own economical/financial interests. Also every actor in the bitcoin network is free to quit or liquidate completely his/her saving/investments at anytime permissionless.\r\n\r\n> > If such kind of rational actors do not agree to provide storage for non-financial-transaction-bits (since once the e.g. 1 TB SSD is full, these actors will not buy a SSD of bigger capacity and provide this resource to the bitcoin network) then, they will change to run a Light-Node (to participate sovereignly in the network).\r\n> \r\n>> What is the reason not to upgrade the 1 TB SSD, once full? Storage cost is one of which falls in price the fastest. The storage can only increase max about 210 GB per year, no further, and we are at about 550 GB, so that means at least 2 years more. By then, prices will likely have fallen even further (in 2 years, price for an example 2 TB SSD has fallen 63% from about $440 to $160 -- https://3cmls.co/US/B08RK2SR23, so might be $60 in another 2 years, which would be 25% cheaper than the average price of 1 TB SSD now).\r\n>> \r\nAs exposed above. His/her ideological motives; which is a fact to consider among the bitcoin network participants.\r\n>\r\n> And anyway, segwit already locked in the max of about 210 GB storage increase per year, and segwit had consensus, so this should be expected and supported and assumed by a runner of a full node, irrespective of the form the txs take ('normal' txs or arbitrary data txs).\r\n> \r\n> Plus, arbitrary data txs have already occurred throughout Bitcoin's history via p2ms, before Inscriptions-based arbitrary data ever became a thing, so this is not actually a new phenomenon. Full node runners have always hosted arbitrary data.\r\n> \r\nThe SegWit in addition with Taproot created a freedom degree in the protocol to include less restrictive non-financial-transaction-bits, which is now been exploited by the Ordinal/Inscription implementation. This changed the characteristics and properties for the blockchain (Timechain) usage without consensus, but de facto. This consensus missing is clearly evidenced in the discussion and divisions expressed among bitcoin network participants on the different social media platforms and protocols (including this formal and official plenum for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals).\r\n\r\n> > This rational action could have the total effect to reduce the decentralization and security of the bitcoin network.\r\n> \r\n> Sure, everyone makes their own decisions, so full node runners must choose too. On the other hand, there have been reports from many that demand to run full nodes has jumped dramatically (one report indicated more demand to run full nodes in a matter of weeks/months recently than in prior 5 years total), so while there may be some loss due to ideological reasons, there may also be some gain due to new users entering Bitcoin. We will have to wait to see the full net effect on full nodes.\r\n> \r\n> > It would be in interest of all the bitcoin network’s stakeholders to take decisions/actions in consensus\r\n> \r\n> Ordinals and Inscriptions do not require consensus to operate. They are not forks of any kind.\r\n> \r\nWhich at the same time, following this argument, implies the not necessity for creating a BIP number or in its defect an informative BIP for the bitcoin community. Ordinals and Inscription did not follow the social consensus workflow, but put in the wild de facto through exploiting a freedom degree created from previous formal consensus.\r\n\r\n> Ordinals are simply an arbitrary way of thinking about sats that categories sats into different levels of \"rarity\", like with the numismatic value of fiat coins. Meanwhile, Inscriptions are technically-valid Bitcoin txs that allow arbitrary data storage. Both are enabled via a custom wallet that lets one distinguish and work with sats, functionality that is required by both.\r\n> \r\n> > and strengthen the incentives of Full-Node-Runners to provide storage resource.\r\n> \r\n> Already discussed previously in this message, so won't repeat.\r\n> \r\n> > Focusing only on the economical/financial incentives of miner-actors ceteris paribus\r\n> \r\n> Just to be clear, the miners are critical elements of the network, in terms of the security they provide. The full nodes' contribution to security is not even in the same realm as that provided by miners. It has always been known that the miners' compensation, via subsidy, is exponentially falling every 4 years, and so it requires to be compensated for by fees (generated by txs on the base layer). This means blocks should be full to generate fee pressure and a fee market, so that high-enough-fee rate txs (economically competitive txs) become the norm on the base layer. It is very very very important to focus on incentives of miners; it is IMO the most important element of the Bitcoin network, since without security everything falls apart.\r\n> \r\nThe bitcoin network (including some miner-actors) was able to survive in the free market for quite more than 14 years. Exponentially falling subsidy every 4 years was clear exposed at the very beginning of bitcoin network design and operation in the wild. This fee pressure and market competition should be assumed by every miner-actor and do not require any intervention from the bitcoin community to provide any miner support via non-financial-transactional-fee compensation.\r\nIf the bitcoin network can not survive with its original design and operation without intervention tried to be achieved via Ordinal/Inscription implementation, then its existence will be wiped out by the free market; which is our common ideology or efficient economical way of thinking.\r\n\r\n> > would destabilize the storage resources allocation, centralize and insecure the network against malicious actions/actors.\r\n> \r\n> Already discussed previously in this message, so won't repeat. But, even encountering a net reduction of for example 5,000 full nodes out of 100,000+ full nodes does not move the needle.\r\n> \r\n> > In consequence, as @luke-jr proposed: the autor of this proposal is encouraged to withdraw it and abandon it entirely. The autor of this proposal is free to pursue innovations and ideas in e.g. an OIP-0001 or the likes.\r\n> \r\n> Withdrawing the proposal would achieve nothing materially positive; it would only maybe negatively affect the situation, since it could make it harder to improve the proposal, and maybe make it harder to have a single source of truth re: the proposal.\r\n> \r\nSince Ordinal/Inscription is not a bitcoin community proposal there is not evidence at all its withdrawal could have any negative effects for Bitcoin.\r\n\r\n> Abandoning it would do nothing to change the operation of it, either. This development is an example of Bitcoin's permissionless innovation characteristic: it's already released into the wild, so now the free market has taken over and will decide to what degree Ordinals & Inscriptions gain traction.\r\n> \r\n> Based on comments by experts of the BIP process (not the people who have used their comments and emojis to indicate disapproval of the BIP itself), including Luke himself, this BIP is legitimate and lacks any good reason not to be accepted.\r\n> \r\nA reason to not accept this proposal is not in keeping with the Bitcoin philosophy; in which a social consensus ex-ante shall be reached.\r\n\r\n> I hope my message has helped clarify why, on the aspect of financial incentive for full node runners and possible incentive of Inscriptions to reduce full nodes, the situation is not so clearly negative as may first be imagined.\r\n\r\nA hope also, a help could be provided to a deeper understanding of this situation.",

      "body": "> But this is not about what people do with the Bitcoin protocol or Bitcoin Wallets, but with what people do with the ordinals NFT protocol and monkeypics wallets. Whether or not that scheme uses Bitcoin is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, this BIP describes ordinals and not inscriptions. Ordinals are essentially like augmented reality glasses for Bitcoin that enable tracking of sats. This technology alone doesn't seem to have any direct connection to NFTs or jpegs. As for the so-called \"inscriptions\", those could be classified as spam, but this BIP does not touch on this topic.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the backlash this PR received was unwarranted. Those who do not find the idea of these AR glasses appealing can simply not put them on (which is the default setting anyway). The real question at hand is whether or not a BIP that provides a means for individuals to augment their interpretation of the chain is allowed. Personally, I believe we shouldn't block this, and therefore support merging this.",

That BIP gives, among others, reasons for rejection; one of them, “[..] not in keeping with the Bitcoin philosophy”. Such not philosophy keeping was already exposed in various arguments above.\r\n\r\n> Isn't it your role to accept or reject BIPs, based on whether they meet the BIP rules (and not based on personal opinion of whether it is \"good or bad for bitcoin\")? If not, who has this role?\r\n>\r\nSince Bitcoin Network (technically as well as socially) needs agreement between its parties to exists (or at least to keep the probability of its survival) and since this proposal has not demonstrated social agreement (name it if you want: “consensus”) between its relevant participants, in particular participants running full-nodes, and following BIP0002, the logical consequence is the rejection of this proposal.\r\n\r\n",

The BIP list would end up looking absurd and devolve into an EIP list.\r\n\r\nUntil Bitcoin's philosophy is clearly and unambiguously addressed in BIP 2, merging this PR would set the wrong precedent by tacitly acknowledging that this PR is in keeping with Bitcoin's philosophy, which, judging by the obvious schism, is highly debatable if not outright dubious.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, there is simply no way to equitably merge this PR without first defining Bitcoin’s philosophy in BIP 2.

In many ways it provides countless opportunities to educate users about why the final paragraph of section 10 is so important, by demonstrating in a very direct way how simple it is to subvert the anonymity of users who do not practice good hygiene in regards to key/coin control.\r\n\r\nAdditionally a BIP MUST:\r\n\"be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement\" - This proposal includes all relevant material needed to implement a client that would be fully compatible with the reference implementation.\r\n\"must represent a net improvement\" - This directly enables users to create/use stable identifiers with no direct tangible case for negatives that outweigh it. \r\n\"must be solid and must not complicate the protocol unduly\" - Reference implementation has no mandatory implementation in Bitcoin protocol and therefore cannot complicate it.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the complaint that it needs to be implemented on independent software(s) is factually false as that criteria applies specifically when checking for \"de facto adoption\" and \"[is] not to be used as reasons to oppose or reject a BIP\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt should be clear at this point, to any unbiased reader, that the refusal to assign a BIP number is not related to this proposal, but is a byproduct of the reference implementation of this proposal also implementing a system that uses SegWit in a way that hurts people's feelings. Having read the discussion the majority of technical/network concerns are concerned with features that are NOT part of this BIP (and make me question if said users actually read the proposed BIP or just Twitter).

This combined with providing features to those who benefit from them make it an unequivocal net improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was tired when I drafted that last night and I hope this is a sufficient expansion upon that point.

Ignore the shit jpegs and think of real humanitarian value.\r\n\r\nComplete NACK\r\nThe BIP mania has made it easier then ever to dump arbitrary data into the current 17.000 Bitcoin's voluntary full nodes. The BIP/PR mania sponsored by most Core Devs who are by definition as service providers in Bitcoin in a situation of permanent conflict of interests, has been absolutely contrary to keeping Bitcoin's scope tyranically (SN's term) TINY. What is needed INSTEAD is to allow/code more options in full nodes CORE software for the 17.000 node runners to choose themselves which functionality and implicitly which arbitrary data dumps to (UN)SUPPORT in their full node. I bet you NONE will be supported by these voluntarily if they have a choice!!!! So, surely NOT to even exploit further the problems that were created by the BIP mania, but instead to allow full node runners to UNSUPPORT it by giving clients of bitcoin=node runners, options. Maybe who knows some full node runner with some mental issues will want to run a HUGE full node voluntarily to support arbitrary data such as illegal data, or nudes, NFT 'art' or documents which could be stored in a p2p network with a scope specifically appropriate for that, as BITCOIN IS NOT AN ALL PURPOSE DATABASE, not even for 'humanitarian' purposes. And BTW congrats for being so altruistic, Ordinals are all about altruism 🤡 BITCOIN IS BY DEFINITION, TO EXIST AND HAVE ANY VALUE based on its value proposition, something that MUST KEEP ITS SCOPE EXTREMELY NARROW. AGAINST THAT, ORDINALS are just one of the exploits, consequence of the CORE DEVS suffering from the altcoining mindset BIP/PR mania, resembling what happened with \"crypto\" 'solutions'. Obviously ALL EXPLOITS, like ordinals, only MAKE THINGS WORSE.",

Altcoiners in Bitcoin are so 'sticky' that they are even able to complaint of the same exact misbehavior they do. Inscriptions ARE ABUSING the Bitcoin current 'system'(setup), and you are complaining (??) now on this exact topic that someone is, by expressing freely my own feelings as the github system allows (just like Bitcoin unfortunately allows inscriptions!!! 🤡) that I am the one 'abusing' my right to express my feelings the most possible about the importance of my own messages and the ones of others on this matter crucial to Bitcoin's survival, which I am sure by your comments waste space here you not care at all about, since IMV you are not focusing on tackling the content of message itself which is what matters?! Furthermore, this system here, GitHub, is IMV already not the most inclusive for bitcoiners node runners, the only true decentralizers of Bitcoin, to express themselves about the BIP mania and how inscriptions and other serious matters must be dealt with. If one cannot express his feelings about a topic in emojis then Github can restrict them. The fact of the matter is that for a true bitcoiner the content of the message must be what matters, not feelings, emojis or who is the messenger. ",

So instead be responsible yourself also responding throroughly to my answer, which you did not yet, because your coment is about the system/Github setup, and zero related to the content of this BIP, which is what matters. When altcoiners lose argumentation they typically try to exclude from the conversation those who do not agree with them. They are even able to accuse the other side, of the same things they do, anything goes. 🤡🤡🤡  Focus on content.",

I even explained without need how Github system allows you to express several feelings about your message and the ones of others which I noticed I can yse and so do you, otherwise they would not exist or you are calling the Github team stupid for setting them up that way? \"Perpetrator\" is probably a word you must be used to hear, not me, I did nothing the system does not allow. The same logic applies to inscriptions and ordinals. Some people prefer to spend their time calling names to each other, or even rightly worried bitcoiners to the 'inscripters/ordinalers'. I would rather spend my precious life time, talking instead about how to make them more and more cumbersome on Bitcoin. Not less, as this proposal is about.",

As mentioned in the ordinals BIP, ordinals can be used as public identifiers that can receive bitcoin payments, where the underlying private keys can be swapped, to allow for private key rotation in case of compromise or a change in the underlying custody setup. Alice tells Bob the ordinal number of a sat that she controls, and Bob can send bitcoin to the address holding that sat. Alice can then transfer that sat to a new address, indicating that going forward, she wishes to be paid at that new address. Alice can swap address types, private keys, or any other aspect of her custody setup and need communicate no new information to Bob to continue receiving payments from him. This makes ordinals squarely in-scope for a BIP, given the vast number of other BIPS concerning addresses, wallets, and payment methods, which would surely not be made out-of-scope for a BIP under any reasonable criteria. The fact that it has other applications, like collectable sats and inscriptions, is not a tenable rationale for making ordinals itself out-of-scope for a BIP.\r\n",

      "body": "Ordinal theory, as a theory of satoshi numbering, is a very appropriate result to be proposed as a BIP for discussion. I hope that eventually ordinal theory can be accepted by the BTC main network.\r\nHowever, before accepting the ordinal theory, I think it is necessary to seriously discuss whether there are any areas in the ordinal theory that need fine-tuning. For example, some of the current principles of the ordinal theory conflict with the principles of BTC. These conflicting areas require necessary adjustments. For example, ordinal theory believes that satoshis will be destroyed, and there are many ordinal numbers that do not have satoshis behind them, which means that the numbers are not continuous, but intermittent. I think these are areas worth fine-tuning. For specific discussion, please refer to this issue.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ordinals/ord/issues/3690#issuecomment-2083950493",

      "body": "Where the ordinal theory needs fine-tuning: \r\n1. The Ordinals protocol allows for the destruction of sats. In fact, in the ordinals ordinal theory system, 2,895,502,904 sats have already been destroyed. This result can be verified by querying the Ordinals website (https://ordinals.com/status).\r\n2. The Ordinals protocol assigns ordinals to sats based on theory, resulting in many ordinals that do not have corresponding actual sats. For example, at block height 840,000, which is the fourth halving, the first sat of that block, called \"epic,\" has the ordinal 1,968,750,000,000,000. This may lead to the misconception that 19,687,500 BTC have already been issued. However, in reality, before reaching this height, there were less than 19,687,497.2 BTC in circulation due to several reward blocks not being fully claimed. Therefore, in the ordinals ordinal theory, behind the ordinal 1,968,750,000,000,000 of the epic sat during the fourth halving, there are many ordinals without corresponding sats.\r\n\r\nI suggest that ordinal theory be adjusted to the following rules: \r\n1. The ordinal of the first sat is 0.\r\n2. Numbering continues in the order of birth without any gaps.\r\n3. Sat transfers follow the first-in, first-out principle.\r\n4. In reward transactions, the rewarded sat is the first input, and other transaction fees are sequentially added after it.\r\n5. The number of rewarded sats strictly matches the actual reward quantity.\r\n\r\nAmong them, 2 and 5 have some differences from the current ordinal theory.\r\n",

Moreover, the suggestion that sex or bribes might be involved with a number assignment probably doesn't increase the motivation to do.\r\n\r\nIt’s only a half troll... I remember taking luke-jr defense in 2021 when a lot of people were talking about doing a bypass of its janitorial role as a bip maintainer and that time asking publicly the github organization admins to appoint _without consensus_ new maintainers to have a bip number assigned to the BIP proposal they favored.\r\n\r\nI also think all the set of bips that were proposing increases of the block size (100, 101, 102, 103), whatever their level of technical seriousness where assigned a BIP, and all of them had more serious implications on the long-term technical and economical stability of the bitcoin peer-to-peer network, that this simple BIP had.\r\n\r\nThere are sound conversations to add on the long-term effects of colored coins protocol on the Bitcoin ecosystem, though in a world of pay-to-contract and vanity addresses, ordinals are on a par with as an idea.\r\n\r\nSo for an external observer, it’s unclear why the BIP is not assigned a number, after all it’s probable that all BIP maintainers have sharing communication channel to coordinate the assignment of number, otherwise it’s unclear how they avoid potential collisions in assignment due to working in an asynchronous digital work environment.",

The main change, point 2, would be that when a miner underpays the block reward, causing new sats to be destroyed, this be reflected in the numbering of sats in subsequent blocks. This would require that, in order to know when a sat with a particular number was created, you look back at all previous blocks to see if any had been destroyed, and so would greatly complicate implementations, and turn what previously were O(1) calculations into `O(N)` calculations, where N is the number of blocks, without a clear benefit.\r\n\r\nThe author writes that point 5 is also a change, but I'm not sure what they mean by it.\r\n\r\nIn any case, ordinals is already widely deployed as is, so this BIP seeks to document it in its existing state.",

Most people don't care whether a satoshi's current ordinal number is n or m. Those who care are more familiar with technical details and pay more attention to the security of BTC and the indestructible nature of satoshis themselves. Satoshis can be lost, but the introduction of a BIP should not lead to the destruction of existing satoshis. This is unacceptable both technically and emotionally. \r\n\r\nMoreover, the Ordinals protocol also claims that Satoshi is indestructible, so why not unify the theory and implementation? Is there any reason to leave a gap that could destroy a Satoshi?",

Those that use them find value in them, if they aren't directly harmful to another user's usage of bitcoin (within the constraints of Bitcoin itself) than there is a meaningful argument for the inclusion as a bip.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the standardized practice of treating bitcoin flows as a queue (fifo) has multiple implementations that all align with this spec and this process provides meaningful value to those who choose to use it. Additionally, there is no impact on other bitcoiners as this tracking/ordering mechanism doesn't have any enforced impact on anyone who doesn't choose to engage with it.\r\n\r\nWhile many incompetent users may _feel_ that this harms them in some way, there is zero technical harm in this which is why we keep seeing impassioned comments about how deriving an ordinal numbering scheme from ordered flows is 'an attack on bitcoin' without any concrete example thereof.",

      "body": "> While I don't see this as an effective attack on bitcoin, I also fail to see it as an improvement for bitcoin in any way.\n\nTx fees are supposed to replace the exponentially-dwindling subsidy to secure bitcoin, yet tx fees are currently at best about 0.1 BTC/block, or at best about 0.025% per year, with no apparent positive trend in tx fees that gives confidence that tx fees will materialize in sufficient amount in the coming years. \n\nSimultaneously, we do not know what % of supply miners need in tx fees for bitcoin to be secured and sustainable. This implies working to generate some modicum of tx fees at least: not 0.025% per year, but instead for example maybe at least 0.5% per year... 20x greater fees. We don't know how much, to emphasize, but certainly much more than what we currently have. Fees > subsidy is the goal.\n\nBack to this BIP: Ordinals represent a new source of tx demand for bitcoin (via satisfying bitcoin gambling demand, bitcoin numismatic demand with analog to analog world of money, etc.), and thus a new source of tx fees.\n\nSo, that is one improvement. Since bitcoin's security is a critical issue, this is a relatively big improvement.",

For a BIP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement. The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate the protocol unduly.\r\n\r\nThe \"must represent a net improvement\" is a bit of a grey area but when unsure I think the BIP editors should lean towards giving the BIP number.

A\n+satpoint consists of an outpoint, i.e., a transaction ID and output index, with\n+the addition of the offset of the ordinal within that output. For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+`680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6`\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.\n+\n+''Congestion: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+transactions, and drive up fees.''\n+\n+Since Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong\n+positive of the proposal.\n+\n+''UTXO set bloat: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+entries in the UTXO set, and thus increase the size of the UTXO set, which all\n+full nodes are required to track.''\n+\n+The dust limit, which makes outputs with small values difficult to create,\n+should encourage users to create non-dust outputs, and to clean them up once\n+they no longer have use for the sats that they contain.\n+\n+=== Security ===\n+\n+The public key associated with a sat may change. This requires actively\n+following the blockchain to keep up with key changes, and requires care\n+compared to a system where public keys are static. However, a system with\n+static public keys suffers from an inability for keys to be rotated or accounts\n+to change hands.\n+\n+Ordinal-aware software must avoid losing valuable sats by unintentionally\n+relinquishing them in a transaction, either to a non-controlled output or by\n+using them as fees.\n+\n+=== Privacy considerations ===\n+\n+Ordinals are opt-in, and should not impact the privacy of existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals are themselves public, however, this is required by the fact that many\n+of the applications that they are intended to enable require public\n+identifiers.\n+\n+Ordinal aware software should never mix sats which might have some publicly\n+visible data associated with their ordinals with sats intended for use in\n+payments or savings, since this would associate that publicly visible data with\n+the users otherwise pseudonymous wallet outputs.\n+\n+=== Fungibility considerations ===\n+\n+Since any sat can be sent to any address at any time, sat that are transferred,\n+even those with some public history, should be considered to be fungible with\n+other sats with no such history.\n+\n+=== Backward compatibility ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are fully backwards compatible and require no changes to the\n+bitcoin network.\n+\n+=== Drawbacks ===\n+\n+==== Large Index Size ====\n+\n+Indexes supporting fast queries related to ordinals are slow to build and\n+consume large amounts of space.\n+\n+An O(1) index that maps UTXOs to the ordinals that they contain is currently\n+100 GiB. The same index including spent outputs is 10 TiB.",

For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+<code>680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6</code>\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.",

The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.\n+\n+''Congestion: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+transactions, and drive up fees.''\n+\n+Since Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong\n+positive of the proposal.\n+\n+''UTXO set bloat: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+entries in the UTXO set, and thus increase the size of the UTXO set, which all\n+full nodes are required to track.''\n+\n+The dust limit, which makes outputs with small values difficult to create,\n+should encourage users to create non-dust outputs, and to clean them up once\n+they no longer have use for the sats that they contain.",

Addresses are\n+single-use, and wallet accounts are private. Additionally, the use of addresses\n+or public keys as stable identifiers precludes transfer of ownership or key\n+rotation.\n+\n+This proposal is motivated by the desire to provide stable identifiers that may\n+be used by Bitcoin applications.\n+\n+== Description ==\n+\n+=== Design ===\n+\n+Every sat is serially numbered, starting at 0, in the order in which it is\n+mined. These numbers are termed \"ordinal numbers\", or \"ordinals\", as they are\n+ordinal numbers in the mathematical sense, giving the order of each sat in the\n+total supply. The word \"ordinal\" is nicely unambiguous, as it is not used\n+elsewhere in the Bitcoin protocol.\n+\n+The ordinal numbers of sats in transaction inputs are transferred to output\n+sats in first-in-first-out order, according to the size and order of the\n+transactions inputs and outputs.\n+\n+If a transaction is mined with the same transaction ID as outputs currently in\n+the UTXO set, following the behavior of Bitcoin Core, the new transaction\n+outputs displace the older UTXO set entries, destroying the sats contained in\n+any unspent outputs of the first transaction. This rule is required to handle\n+the two pairs of mainnet transactions with duplicate transaction IDs, namely\n+the coinbase transactions of blocks 91812/91842, and 91722/91880, mined before\n+[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki BIP-34] made\n+the creation of transactions with duplicate IDs impossible.\n+\n+For the purposes of the assignment algorithm, the coinbase transaction is\n+considered to have an implicit input equal in size to the subsidy, followed by\n+an input for every fee-paying transaction in the block, in the order that those\n+transactions appear in the block. The implicit subsidy input carries the\n+block's newly created sats. The implicit fee inputs carry the sats that were\n+paid as fees in the block's transactions.\n+\n+Underpaying the subsidy does not change the ordinal numbers of sats mined\n+in subsequent blocks. Ordinals depend only on how many sats could have been\n+mined, not how many actually were.\n+\n+=== Specification ===\n+\n+Sats are numbered and transferred with the following algorithm:\n+\n+<source lang=\"python\">\n+# subsidy of block at given height\n+def subsidy(height):\n+  return 50 * 100_000_000 >> height // 210_000\n+\n+# first ordinal of subsidy of block at given height\n+def first_ordinal(height):\n+  start = 0\n+  for height in range(height):\n+    start += subsidy(height)\n+  return start\n+\n+# assign ordinals in given block\n+def assign_ordinals(block):\n+  first = first_ordinal(block.height)\n+  last = first + subsidy(block.height)\n+  coinbase_ordinals = list(range(first, last))\n+\n+  for transaction in block.transactions[1:]:\n+    ordinals = []\n+    for input in transaction.inputs:\n+      ordinals.extend(input.ordinals)\n+\n+    for output in transaction.outputs:\n+      output.ordinals = ordinals[:output.value]\n+      del ordinals[:output.value]\n+\n+    coinbase_ordinals.extend(ordinals)\n+\n+  for output in block.transaction[0].outputs:\n+    output.ordinals = coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+    del coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+</source>\n+\n+A miner may underpay the block reward, in which case\n+<code>coinbase_ordinals</code> will not be empty when\n+<code>assign_ordinals</code> returns. These sats are lost and not assigned to\n+any output of the coinbase transaction.\n+\n+=== Terminology and Notation ===\n+\n+A satpoint may be used to indicate the location of a sat within an output. A\n+satpoint consists of an outpoint, i.e., a transaction ID and output index, with\n+the addition of the offset of the ordinal within that output. For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+<code>680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6</code>\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively.

Addresses are\n+single-use, and wallet accounts are private. Additionally, the use of addresses\n+or public keys as stable identifiers precludes transfer of ownership or key\n+rotation.\n+\n+This proposal is motivated by the desire to provide stable identifiers that may\n+be used by Bitcoin applications.\n+\n+== Description ==\n+\n+=== Design ===\n+\n+Every sat is serially numbered, starting at 0, in the order in which it is\n+mined. These numbers are termed \"ordinal numbers\", or \"ordinals\", as they are\n+ordinal numbers in the mathematical sense, giving the order of each sat in the\n+total supply. The word \"ordinal\" is nicely unambiguous, as it is not used\n+elsewhere in the Bitcoin protocol.\n+\n+The ordinal numbers of sats in transaction inputs are transferred to output\n+sats in first-in-first-out order, according to the size and order of the\n+transactions inputs and outputs.\n+\n+If a transaction is mined with the same transaction ID as outputs currently in\n+the UTXO set, following the behavior of Bitcoin Core, the new transaction\n+outputs displace the older UTXO set entries, destroying the sats contained in\n+any unspent outputs of the first transaction. This rule is required to handle\n+the two pairs of mainnet transactions with duplicate transaction IDs, namely\n+the coinbase transactions of blocks 91812/91842, and 91722/91880, mined before\n+[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki BIP-34] made\n+the creation of transactions with duplicate IDs impossible.\n+\n+For the purposes of the assignment algorithm, the coinbase transaction is\n+considered to have an implicit input equal in size to the subsidy, followed by\n+an input for every fee-paying transaction in the block, in the order that those\n+transactions appear in the block. The implicit subsidy input carries the\n+block's newly created sats. The implicit fee inputs carry the sats that were\n+paid as fees in the block's transactions.\n+\n+Underpaying the subsidy does not change the ordinal numbers of sats mined\n+in subsequent blocks. Ordinals depend only on how many sats could have been\n+mined, not how many actually were.\n+\n+=== Specification ===\n+\n+Sats are numbered and transferred with the following algorithm:\n+\n+<source lang=\"python\">\n+# subsidy of block at given height\n+def subsidy(height):\n+  return 50 * 100_000_000 >> height // 210_000\n+\n+# first ordinal of subsidy of block at given height\n+def first_ordinal(height):\n+  start = 0\n+  for height in range(height):\n+    start += subsidy(height)\n+  return start\n+\n+# assign ordinals in given block\n+def assign_ordinals(block):\n+  first = first_ordinal(block.height)\n+  last = first + subsidy(block.height)\n+  coinbase_ordinals = list(range(first, last))\n+\n+  for transaction in block.transactions[1:]:\n+    ordinals = []\n+    for input in transaction.inputs:\n+      ordinals.extend(input.ordinals)\n+\n+    for output in transaction.outputs:\n+      output.ordinals = ordinals[:output.value]\n+      del ordinals[:output.value]\n+\n+    coinbase_ordinals.extend(ordinals)\n+\n+  for output in block.transaction[0].outputs:\n+    output.ordinals = coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+    del coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+</source>\n+\n+A miner may underpay the block reward, in which case\n+<code>coinbase_ordinals</code> will not be empty when\n+<code>assign_ordinals</code> returns. These sats are lost and not assigned to\n+any output of the coinbase transaction.\n+\n+=== Terminology and Notation ===\n+\n+A satpoint may be used to indicate the location of a sat within an output. A\n+satpoint consists of an outpoint, i.e., a transaction ID and output index, with\n+the addition of the offset of the ordinal within that output. For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+<code>680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6</code>\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.\n+\n+''Congestion: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+transactions, and drive up fees.''\n+\n+Since Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong\n+positive of the proposal.\n+\n+''UTXO set bloat: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+entries in the UTXO set, and thus increase the size of the UTXO set, which all\n+full nodes are required to track.''\n+\n+The dust limit, which makes outputs with small values difficult to create,\n+should encourage users to create non-dust outputs, and to clean them up once\n+they no longer have use for the sats that they contain.\n+\n+=== Security ===\n+\n+The public key associated with a sat may change.

Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.\n+\n+''Congestion: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+transactions, and drive up fees.''\n+\n+Since Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong\n+positive of the proposal.\n+\n+''UTXO set bloat: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+entries in the UTXO set, and thus increase the size of the UTXO set, which all\n+full nodes are required to track.''\n+\n+The dust limit, which makes outputs with small values difficult to create,\n+should encourage users to create non-dust outputs, and to clean them up once\n+they no longer have use for the sats that they contain.\n+\n+=== Security ===\n+\n+The public key associated with a sat may change. This requires actively\n+following the blockchain to keep up with key changes, and requires care\n+compared to a system where public keys are static. However, a system with\n+static public keys suffers from an inability for keys to be rotated or accounts\n+to change hands.\n+\n+Ordinal-aware software must avoid losing valuable sats by unintentionally\n+relinquishing them in a transaction, either to a non-controlled output or by\n+using them as fees.\n+\n+=== Privacy considerations ===\n+\n+Ordinals are opt-in, and should not impact the privacy of existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals are themselves public, however, this is required by the fact that many\n+of the applications that they are intended to enable require public\n+identifiers.\n+\n+Ordinal aware software should never mix sats which might have some publicly\n+visible data associated with their ordinals with sats intended for use in\n+payments or savings, since this would associate that publicly visible data with",

Additionally, the use of addresses\n+or public keys as stable identifiers precludes transfer of ownership or key\n+rotation.\n+\n+This proposal is motivated by the desire to provide stable identifiers that may\n+be used by Bitcoin applications.\n+\n+== Description ==\n+\n+=== Design ===\n+\n+Every sat is serially numbered, starting at 0, in the order in which it is\n+mined. These numbers are termed \"ordinal numbers\", or \"ordinals\", as they are\n+ordinal numbers in the mathematical sense, giving the order of each sat in the\n+total supply. The word \"ordinal\" is nicely unambiguous, as it is not used\n+elsewhere in the Bitcoin protocol.\n+\n+The ordinal numbers of sats in transaction inputs are transferred to output\n+sats in first-in-first-out order, according to the size and order of the\n+transactions inputs and outputs.\n+\n+If a transaction is mined with the same transaction ID as outputs currently in\n+the UTXO set, following the behavior of Bitcoin Core, the new transaction\n+outputs displace the older UTXO set entries, destroying the sats contained in\n+any unspent outputs of the first transaction. This rule is required to handle\n+the two pairs of mainnet transactions with duplicate transaction IDs, namely\n+the coinbase transactions of blocks 91812/91842, and 91722/91880, mined before\n+[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki BIP-34] made\n+the creation of transactions with duplicate IDs impossible.\n+\n+For the purposes of the assignment algorithm, the coinbase transaction is\n+considered to have an implicit input equal in size to the subsidy, followed by\n+an input for every fee-paying transaction in the block, in the order that those\n+transactions appear in the block. The implicit subsidy input carries the\n+block's newly created sats. The implicit fee inputs carry the sats that were\n+paid as fees in the block's transactions.\n+\n+Underpaying the subsidy does not change the ordinal numbers of sats mined\n+in subsequent blocks. Ordinals depend only on how many sats could have been\n+mined, not how many actually were.\n+\n+=== Specification ===\n+\n+Sats are numbered and transferred with the following algorithm:\n+\n+<source lang=\"python\">\n+# subsidy of block at given height\n+def subsidy(height):\n+  return 50 * 100_000_000 >> height // 210_000\n+\n+# first ordinal of subsidy of block at given height\n+def first_ordinal(height):\n+  start = 0\n+  for height in range(height):\n+    start += subsidy(height)\n+  return start\n+\n+# assign ordinals in given block\n+def assign_ordinals(block):\n+  first = first_ordinal(block.height)\n+  last = first + subsidy(block.height)\n+  coinbase_ordinals = list(range(first, last))\n+\n+  for transaction in block.transactions[1:]:\n+    ordinals = []\n+    for input in transaction.inputs:\n+      ordinals.extend(input.ordinals)\n+\n+    for output in transaction.outputs:\n+      output.ordinals = ordinals[:output.value]\n+      del ordinals[:output.value]\n+\n+    coinbase_ordinals.extend(ordinals)\n+\n+  for output in block.transaction[0].outputs:\n+    output.ordinals = coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+    del coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+</source>\n+\n+A miner may underpay the block reward, in which case\n+<code>coinbase_ordinals</code> will not be empty when\n+<code>assign_ordinals</code> returns. These sats are lost and not assigned to\n+any output of the coinbase transaction.\n+\n+=== Terminology and Notation ===\n+\n+A satpoint may be used to indicate the location of a sat within an output. A\n+satpoint consists of an outpoint, i.e., a transaction ID and output index, with\n+the addition of the offset of the ordinal within that output. For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+<code>680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6</code>\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.",

However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.",

The word \"ordinal\" is nicely unambiguous, as it is not used\n+elsewhere in the Bitcoin protocol.\n+\n+The ordinal numbers of sats in transaction inputs are transferred to output\n+sats in first-in-first-out order, according to the size and order of the\n+transactions inputs and outputs.\n+\n+If a transaction is mined with the same transaction ID as outputs currently in\n+the UTXO set, following the behavior of Bitcoin Core, the new transaction\n+outputs displace the older UTXO set entries, destroying the sats contained in\n+any unspent outputs of the first transaction. This rule is required to handle\n+the two pairs of mainnet transactions with duplicate transaction IDs, namely\n+the coinbase transactions of blocks 91812/91842, and 91722/91880, mined before\n+[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki BIP-34] made\n+the creation of transactions with duplicate IDs impossible.\n+\n+For the purposes of the assignment algorithm, the coinbase transaction is\n+considered to have an implicit input equal in size to the subsidy, followed by\n+an input for every fee-paying transaction in the block, in the order that those\n+transactions appear in the block. The implicit subsidy input carries the\n+block's newly created sats. The implicit fee inputs carry the sats that were\n+paid as fees in the block's transactions.\n+\n+Underpaying the subsidy does not change the ordinal numbers of sats mined\n+in subsequent blocks. Ordinals depend only on how many sats could have been\n+mined, not how many actually were.\n+\n+=== Specification ===\n+\n+Sats are numbered and transferred with the following algorithm:\n+\n+<source lang=\"python\">\n+# subsidy of block at given height\n+def subsidy(height):\n+  return 50 * 100_000_000 >> height // 210_000\n+\n+# first ordinal of subsidy of block at given height\n+def first_ordinal(height):\n+  start = 0\n+  for height in range(height):\n+    start += subsidy(height)\n+  return start\n+\n+# assign ordinals in given block\n+def assign_ordinals(block):\n+  first = first_ordinal(block.height)\n+  last = first + subsidy(block.height)\n+  coinbase_ordinals = list(range(first, last))\n+\n+  for transaction in block.transactions[1:]:\n+    ordinals = []\n+    for input in transaction.inputs:\n+      ordinals.extend(input.ordinals)\n+\n+    for output in transaction.outputs:\n+      output.ordinals = ordinals[:output.value]\n+      del ordinals[:output.value]\n+\n+    coinbase_ordinals.extend(ordinals)\n+\n+  for output in block.transaction[0].outputs:\n+    output.ordinals = coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+    del coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+</source>\n+\n+A miner may underpay the block reward, in which case\n+<code>coinbase_ordinals</code> will not be empty when\n+<code>assign_ordinals</code> returns. These sats are lost and not assigned to\n+any output of the coinbase transaction.\n+\n+=== Terminology and Notation ===\n+\n+A satpoint may be used to indicate the location of a sat within an output. A\n+satpoint consists of an outpoint, i.e., a transaction ID and output index, with\n+the addition of the offset of the ordinal within that output. For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+<code>680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6</code>\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.\n+\n+''Congestion: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+transactions, and drive up fees.''\n+\n+Since Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong\n+positive of the proposal.\n+\n+''UTXO set bloat: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+entries in the UTXO set, and thus increase the size of the UTXO set, which all\n+full nodes are required to track.''\n+\n+The dust limit, which makes outputs with small values difficult to create,\n+should encourage users to create non-dust outputs, and to clean them up once\n+they no longer have use for the sats that they contain.\n+\n+=== Security ===\n+\n+The public key associated with a sat may change. This requires actively\n+following the blockchain to keep up with key changes, and requires care\n+compared to a system where public keys are static. However, a system with\n+static public keys suffers from an inability for keys to be rotated or accounts\n+to change hands.\n+\n+Ordinal-aware software must avoid losing valuable sats by unintentionally\n+relinquishing them in a transaction, either to a non-controlled output or by\n+using them as fees.",

These numbers are termed \"ordinal numbers\", or \"ordinals\", as they are\n+ordinal numbers in the mathematical sense, giving the order of each sat in the\n+total supply.

This rule is required to handle\n+the two pairs of mainnet transactions with duplicate transaction IDs, namely\n+the coinbase transactions of blocks 91812/91842, and 91722/91880, mined before\n+[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki BIP-34] made\n+the creation of transactions with duplicate IDs impossible.\n+\n+For the purposes of the assignment algorithm, the coinbase transaction is\n+considered to have an implicit input equal in size to the subsidy, followed by\n+an input for every fee-paying transaction in the block, in the order that those\n+transactions appear in the block. The implicit subsidy input carries the\n+block's newly created sats. The implicit fee inputs carry the sats that were\n+paid as fees in the block's transactions.\n+\n+Underpaying the subsidy does not change the ordinal numbers of sats mined\n+in subsequent blocks. Ordinals depend only on how many sats could have been\n+mined, not how many actually were.\n+\n+=== Specification ===\n+\n+Sats are numbered and transferred with the following algorithm:\n+\n+<source lang=\"python\">\n+# subsidy of block at given height\n+def subsidy(height):\n+  return 50 * 100_000_000 >> height // 210_000\n+\n+# first ordinal of subsidy of block at given height\n+def first_ordinal(height):\n+  start = 0\n+  for height in range(height):\n+    start += subsidy(height)\n+  return start\n+\n+# assign ordinals in given block\n+def assign_ordinals(block):\n+  first = first_ordinal(block.height)\n+  last = first + subsidy(block.height)\n+  coinbase_ordinals = list(range(first, last))\n+\n+  for transaction in block.transactions[1:]:\n+    ordinals = []\n+    for input in transaction.inputs:\n+      ordinals.extend(input.ordinals)\n+\n+    for output in transaction.outputs:\n+      output.ordinals = ordinals[:output.value]\n+      del ordinals[:output.value]\n+\n+    coinbase_ordinals.extend(ordinals)\n+\n+  for output in block.transaction[0].outputs:\n+    output.ordinals = coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+    del coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+</source>\n+\n+A miner may underpay the block reward, in which case\n+<code>coinbase_ordinals</code> will not be empty when\n+<code>assign_ordinals</code> returns. These sats are lost and not assigned to\n+any output of the coinbase transaction.\n+\n+=== Terminology and Notation ===\n+\n+A satpoint may be used to indicate the location of a sat within an output. A\n+satpoint consists of an outpoint, i.e., a transaction ID and output index, with\n+the addition of the offset of the ordinal within that output. For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+<code>680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6</code>\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.\n+\n+''Congestion: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+transactions, and drive up fees.''\n+\n+Since Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong\n+positive of the proposal.\n+\n+''UTXO set bloat: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+entries in the UTXO set, and thus increase the size of the UTXO set, which all\n+full nodes are required to track.''\n+\n+The dust limit, which makes outputs with small values difficult to create,\n+should encourage users to create non-dust outputs, and to clean them up once\n+they no longer have use for the sats that they contain.\n+\n+=== Security ===\n+\n+The public key associated with a sat may change. This requires actively\n+following the blockchain to keep up with key changes, and requires care\n+compared to a system where public keys are static. However, a system with\n+static public keys suffers from an inability for keys to be rotated or accounts\n+to change hands.\n+\n+Ordinal-aware software must avoid losing valuable sats by unintentionally\n+relinquishing them in a transaction, either to a non-controlled output or by\n+using them as fees.\n+\n+=== Privacy considerations ===\n+\n+Ordinals are opt-in, and should not impact the privacy of existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals are themselves public, however, this is required by the fact that many\n+of the applications that they are intended to enable require public\n+identifiers.\n+\n+Ordinal aware software should never mix sats which might have some publicly\n+visible data associated with their ordinals with sats intended for use in\n+payments or savings, since this would associate that publicly visible data with\n+the users otherwise pseudonymous wallet outputs.\n+\n+=== Fungibility considerations ===\n+\n+Since any sat can be sent to any address at any time, sat that are transferred,\n+even those with some public history, should be considered to be fungible with\n+other sats with no such history.\n+\n+=== Backward compatibility ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are fully backwards compatible and require no changes to the\n+bitcoin network.\n+\n+=== Drawbacks ===\n+\n+==== Large Index Size ====\n+\n+Indexes supporting fast queries related to ordinals are slow to build and\n+consume large amounts of space.\n+\n+As of January, 2023, an O(1) index that maps UTXOs to the ordinals that they\n+contain is 100 GiB. The same index including spent outputs is 10 TiB.\n+\n+An O(1) index supporting the opposite mapping, that of individual ordinals to\n+the UTXO that contains them, is likely to be intractable. However, an O(n)\n+index where n is the number of times an ordinal has changed hands, is fast and\n+practical.\n+\n+==== Large Location Proofs ====\n+\n+A proof can be constructed that demonstrates that a particular sat is contained\n+in a particular output, however the proofs are large. Such a proof consists of:\n+\n+* Block headers\n+* A Merkle path to the coinbase transaction that created the sat\n+* The coinbase transaction that created the sat\n+* And for every spend of that sat:\n+** The spend transaction\n+** The transactions that created the inputs before the input that was spent, to determine the values of the preceding inputs, to determine the position of the sat\n+** And, if the sat was used as fees, all prior transaction in the block in which it was spent, and the coinbase transaction, to determine the location of the sat in the outputs.",

For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+<code>680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6</code>\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.\n+\n+''Congestion: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+transactions, and drive up fees.''\n+\n+Since Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong\n+positive of the proposal.\n+\n+''UTXO set bloat: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+entries in the UTXO set, and thus increase the size of the UTXO set, which all\n+full nodes are required to track.''\n+\n+The dust limit, which makes outputs with small values difficult to create,\n+should encourage users to create non-dust outputs, and to clean them up once\n+they no longer have use for the sats that they contain.\n+\n+=== Security ===\n+\n+The public key associated with a sat may change. This requires actively\n+following the blockchain to keep up with key changes, and requires care\n+compared to a system where public keys are static. However, a system with\n+static public keys suffers from an inability for keys to be rotated or accounts\n+to change hands.\n+\n+Ordinal-aware software must avoid losing valuable sats by unintentionally\n+relinquishing them in a transaction, either to a non-controlled output or by\n+using them as fees.\n+\n+=== Privacy considerations ===\n+\n+Ordinals are opt-in, and should not impact the privacy of existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals are themselves public, however, this is required by the fact that many\n+of the applications that they are intended to enable require public\n+identifiers.\n+\n+Ordinal aware software should never mix sats which might have some publicly\n+visible data associated with their ordinals with sats intended for use in\n+payments or savings, since this would associate that publicly visible data with\n+the users otherwise pseudonymous wallet outputs.\n+\n+=== Fungibility considerations ===\n+\n+Since any sat can be sent to any address at any time, sat that are transferred,\n+even those with some public history, should be considered to be fungible with\n+other sats with no such history.\n+\n+=== Backward compatibility ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are fully backwards compatible and require no changes to the\n+bitcoin network.\n+\n+=== Drawbacks ===\n+\n+==== Large Index Size ====\n+\n+Indexes supporting fast queries related to ordinals are slow to build and\n+consume large amounts of space.\n+\n+As of January, 2023, an O(1) index that maps UTXOs to the ordinals that they\n+contain is 100 GiB. The same index including spent outputs is 10 TiB.\n+\n+An O(1) index supporting the opposite mapping, that of individual ordinals to\n+the UTXO that contains them, is likely to be intractable. However, an O(n)\n+index where n is the number of times an ordinal has changed hands, is fast and\n+practical.\n+\n+==== Large Location Proofs ====\n+\n+A proof can be constructed that demonstrates that a particular sat is contained\n+in a particular output, however the proofs are large. Such a proof consists of:\n+\n+* Block headers\n+* A Merkle path to the coinbase transaction that created the sat\n+* The coinbase transaction that created the sat\n+* And for every spend of that sat:\n+** The spend transaction\n+** The transactions that created the inputs before the input that was spent, to determine the values of the preceding inputs, to determine the position of the sat\n+** And, if the sat was used as fees, all prior transaction in the block in which it was spent, and the coinbase transaction, to determine the location of the sat in the outputs.",

Standards Track BIPs consist of two parts, a design document and a reference implementation.\r\n\r\nOrdinals does not affect most or all Bitcoin implementations, so it shoudn't be a Standards Track BIP.\r\n\r\n> * An Informational BIP describes a Bitcoin design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Bitcoin community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational BIPs do not necessarily represent a Bitcoin community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementors are free to ignore Informational BIPs or follow their advice.\r\n\r\nOrdinals is essentially an application-level technology, so I think it fits into \"guidelines or information\", and doesn't propose a new feature, so I think it should be a Informational BIP. For example, see [BIP-32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki), Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets. Anyone is free to use HD wallets, or not, similar to ordinals, so I think Informational BIP fits best.\r\n\r\n> * A Process BIP describes a process surrounding Bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process BIPs are like Standards Track BIPs but apply to areas other than the Bitcoin protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Bitcoin's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational BIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Bitcoin development. Any meta-BIP is also considered a Process BIP.\r\n\r\nOrdinals does not require consensus and users are free to ignore ordinals, so this shouldn't be a Process BIP.\r\n",

The implicit subsidy input carries the\n+block's newly created sats. The implicit fee inputs carry the sats that were\n+paid as fees in the block's transactions.\n+\n+Underpaying the subsidy does not change the ordinal numbers of sats mined\n+in subsequent blocks. Ordinals depend only on how many sats could have been\n+mined, not how many actually were.\n+\n+=== Specification ===\n+\n+Sats are numbered and transferred with the following algorithm:\n+\n+<source lang=\"python\">\n+# subsidy of block at given height\n+def subsidy(height):\n+  return 50 * 100_000_000 >> height // 210_000\n+\n+# first ordinal of subsidy of block at given height\n+def first_ordinal(height):\n+  start = 0\n+  for height in range(height):\n+    start += subsidy(height)\n+  return start\n+\n+# assign ordinals in given block\n+def assign_ordinals(block):\n+  first = first_ordinal(block.height)\n+  last = first + subsidy(block.height)\n+  coinbase_ordinals = list(range(first, last))\n+\n+  for transaction in block.transactions[1:]:\n+    ordinals = []\n+    for input in transaction.inputs:\n+      ordinals.extend(input.ordinals)\n+\n+    for output in transaction.outputs:\n+      output.ordinals = ordinals[:output.value]\n+      del ordinals[:output.value]\n+\n+    coinbase_ordinals.extend(ordinals)\n+\n+  for output in block.transaction[0].outputs:\n+    output.ordinals = coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+    del coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+</source>\n+\n+A miner may underpay the block reward, in which case\n+<code>coinbase_ordinals</code> will not be empty when\n+<code>assign_ordinals</code> returns. These sats are lost and not assigned to\n+any output of the coinbase transaction.\n+\n+=== Terminology and Notation ===\n+\n+A satpoint may be used to indicate the location of a sat within an output. A\n+satpoint consists of an outpoint, i.e., a transaction ID and output index, with\n+the addition of the offset of the ordinal within that output. For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+<code>680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6</code>\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.\n+\n+''Congestion: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+transactions, and drive up fees.''\n+\n+Since Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong\n+positive of the proposal.\n+\n+''UTXO set bloat: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+entries in the UTXO set, and thus increase the size of the UTXO set, which all\n+full nodes are required to track.''\n+\n+The dust limit, which makes outputs with small values difficult to create,\n+should encourage users to create non-dust outputs, and to clean them up once\n+they no longer have use for the sats that they contain.",

This rule is required to handle\n+the two pairs of mainnet transactions with duplicate transaction IDs, namely\n+the coinbase transactions of blocks 91812/91842, and 91722/91880, mined before\n+[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki BIP-34] made\n+the creation of transactions with duplicate IDs impossible.\n+\n+For the purposes of the assignment algorithm, the coinbase transaction is\n+considered to have an implicit input equal in size to the subsidy, followed by\n+an input for every fee-paying transaction in the block, in the order that those\n+transactions appear in the block. The implicit subsidy input carries the\n+block's newly created sats. The implicit fee inputs carry the sats that were\n+paid as fees in the block's transactions.\n+\n+Underpaying the subsidy does not change the ordinal numbers of sats mined\n+in subsequent blocks. Ordinals depend only on how many sats could have been\n+mined, not how many actually were.\n+\n+=== Specification ===\n+\n+Sats are numbered and transferred with the following algorithm:\n+\n+<source lang=\"python\">\n+# subsidy of block at given height\n+def subsidy(height):\n+  return 50 * 100_000_000 >> height // 210_000\n+\n+# first ordinal of subsidy of block at given height\n+def first_ordinal(height):\n+  start = 0\n+  for height in range(height):\n+    start += subsidy(height)\n+  return start\n+\n+# assign ordinals in given block\n+def assign_ordinals(block):\n+  first = first_ordinal(block.height)\n+  last = first + subsidy(block.height)\n+  coinbase_ordinals = list(range(first, last))\n+\n+  for transaction in block.transactions[1:]:\n+    ordinals = []\n+    for input in transaction.inputs:\n+      ordinals.extend(input.ordinals)\n+\n+    for output in transaction.outputs:\n+      output.ordinals = ordinals[:output.value]\n+      del ordinals[:output.value]\n+\n+    coinbase_ordinals.extend(ordinals)\n+\n+  for output in block.transaction[0].outputs:\n+    output.ordinals = coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+    del coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+</source>\n+\n+A miner may underpay the block reward, in which case\n+<code>coinbase_ordinals</code> will not be empty when\n+<code>assign_ordinals</code> returns. These sats are lost and not assigned to\n+any output of the coinbase transaction.\n+\n+=== Terminology and Notation ===\n+\n+A satpoint may be used to indicate the location of a sat within an output. A\n+satpoint consists of an outpoint, i.e., a transaction ID and output index, with\n+the addition of the offset of the ordinal within that output. For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+<code>680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6</code>\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.\n+\n+''Congestion: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+transactions, and drive up fees.''\n+\n+Since Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong\n+positive of the proposal.\n+\n+''UTXO set bloat: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+entries in the UTXO set, and thus increase the size of the UTXO set, which all\n+full nodes are required to track.''\n+\n+The dust limit, which makes outputs with small values difficult to create,\n+should encourage users to create non-dust outputs, and to clean them up once\n+they no longer have use for the sats that they contain.\n+\n+=== Security ===\n+\n+The public key associated with a sat may change. This requires actively\n+following the blockchain to keep up with key changes, and requires care\n+compared to a system where public keys are static. However, a system with\n+static public keys suffers from an inability for keys to be rotated or accounts\n+to change hands.\n+\n+Ordinal-aware software must avoid losing valuable sats by unintentionally\n+relinquishing them in a transaction, either to a non-controlled output or by\n+using them as fees.\n+\n+=== Privacy considerations ===\n+\n+Ordinals are opt-in, and should not impact the privacy of existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals are themselves public, however, this is required by the fact that many\n+of the applications that they are intended to enable require public\n+identifiers.\n+\n+Ordinal aware software should never mix sats which might have some publicly\n+visible data associated with their ordinals with sats intended for use in\n+payments or savings, since this would associate that publicly visible data with\n+the users otherwise pseudonymous wallet outputs.\n+\n+=== Fungibility considerations ===\n+\n+Since any sat can be sent to any address at any time, sat that are transferred,\n+even those with some public history, should be considered to be fungible with\n+other sats with no such history.\n+\n+=== Backward compatibility ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are fully backwards compatible and require no changes to the\n+bitcoin network.\n+\n+=== Drawbacks ===\n+\n+==== Large Index Size ====\n+\n+Indexes supporting fast queries related to ordinals are slow to build and\n+consume large amounts of space.\n+\n+As of January, 2023, an O(1) index that maps UTXOs to the ordinals that they\n+contain is 100 GiB. The same index including spent outputs is 10 TiB.\n+\n+An O(1) index supporting the opposite mapping, that of individual ordinals to\n+the UTXO that contains them, is likely to be intractable. However, an O(n)\n+index where n is the number of times an ordinal has changed hands, is fast and\n+practical.\n+\n+==== Large Location Proofs ====\n+\n+A proof can be constructed that demonstrates that a particular sat is contained\n+in a particular output, however the proofs are large. Such a proof consists of:\n+\n+* Block headers\n+* A Merkle path to the coinbase transaction that created the sat\n+* The coinbase transaction that created the sat\n+* And for every spend of that sat:\n+** The spend transaction\n+** The transactions that created the inputs before the input that was spent, to determine the values of the preceding inputs, to determine the position of the sat\n+** And, if the sat was used as fees, all prior transaction in the block in which it was spent, and the coinbase transaction, to determine the location of the sat in the outputs.\n+\n+== Reference implementation ==\n+\n+This document and an implementation of an index that tracks the position of\n+sats in the main chain are maintained [https://github.com/casey/ord here].",

These numbers are termed \"ordinal numbers\", or \"ordinals\", as they are\n+ordinal numbers in the mathematical sense, giving the order of each sat in the\n+total supply. The word \"ordinal\" is nicely unambiguous, as it is not used\n+elsewhere in the Bitcoin protocol.\n+\n+The ordinal numbers of sats in transaction inputs are transferred to output\n+sats in first-in-first-out order, according to the size and order of the\n+transactions inputs and outputs.\n+\n+If a transaction is mined with the same transaction ID as outputs currently in\n+the UTXO set, following the behavior of Bitcoin Core, the new transaction\n+outputs displace the older UTXO set entries, destroying the sats contained in\n+any unspent outputs of the first transaction.

The implicit subsidy input carries the\n+block's newly created sats. The implicit fee inputs carry the sats that were\n+paid as fees in the block's transactions.\n+\n+Underpaying the subsidy does not change the ordinal numbers of sats mined\n+in subsequent blocks. Ordinals depend only on how many sats could have been\n+mined, not how many actually were.\n+\n+=== Specification ===\n+\n+Sats are numbered and transferred with the following algorithm:\n+\n+<source lang=\"python\">\n+# subsidy of block at given height\n+def subsidy(height):\n+  return 50 * 100_000_000 >> height // 210_000\n+\n+# first ordinal of subsidy of block at given height\n+def first_ordinal(height):\n+  start = 0\n+  for height in range(height):\n+    start += subsidy(height)\n+  return start\n+\n+# assign ordinals in given block\n+def assign_ordinals(block):\n+  first = first_ordinal(block.height)\n+  last = first + subsidy(block.height)\n+  coinbase_ordinals = list(range(first, last))\n+\n+  for transaction in block.transactions[1:]:\n+    ordinals = []\n+    for input in transaction.inputs:\n+      ordinals.extend(input.ordinals)\n+\n+    for output in transaction.outputs:\n+      output.ordinals = ordinals[:output.value]\n+      del ordinals[:output.value]\n+\n+    coinbase_ordinals.extend(ordinals)\n+\n+  for output in block.transaction[0].outputs:\n+    output.ordinals = coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+    del coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+</source>\n+\n+A miner may underpay the block reward, in which case\n+<code>coinbase_ordinals</code> will not be empty when\n+<code>assign_ordinals</code> returns. These sats are lost and not assigned to\n+any output of the coinbase transaction.\n+\n+=== Terminology and Notation ===\n+\n+A satpoint may be used to indicate the location of a sat within an output. A\n+satpoint consists of an outpoint, i.e., a transaction ID and output index, with\n+the addition of the offset of the ordinal within that output. For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+<code>680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6</code>\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.\n+\n+''Congestion: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+transactions, and drive up fees.''\n+\n+Since Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong\n+positive of the proposal.\n+\n+''UTXO set bloat: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+entries in the UTXO set, and thus increase the size of the UTXO set, which all\n+full nodes are required to track.''\n+\n+The dust limit, which makes outputs with small values difficult to create,\n+should encourage users to create non-dust outputs, and to clean them up once\n+they no longer have use for the sats that they contain.\n+\n+=== Security ===\n+\n+The public key associated with a sat may change. This requires actively\n+following the blockchain to keep up with key changes, and requires care\n+compared to a system where public keys are static. However, a system with\n+static public keys suffers from an inability for keys to be rotated or accounts\n+to change hands.\n+\n+Ordinal-aware software must avoid losing valuable sats by unintentionally\n+relinquishing them in a transaction, either to a non-controlled output or by\n+using them as fees.\n+\n+=== Privacy considerations ===\n+\n+Ordinals are opt-in, and should not impact the privacy of existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals are themselves public, however, this is required by the fact that many\n+of the applications that they are intended to enable require public\n+identifiers.\n+\n+Ordinal aware software should never mix sats which might have some publicly\n+visible data associated with their ordinals with sats intended for use in\n+payments or savings, since this would associate that publicly visible data with\n+the users otherwise pseudonymous wallet outputs.\n+\n+=== Fungibility considerations ===\n+\n+Since any sat can be sent to any address at any time, sat that are transferred,",

Addresses are\n+single-use, and wallet accounts are private. Additionally, the use of addresses\n+or public keys as stable identifiers precludes transfer of ownership or key\n+rotation.\n+\n+This proposal is motivated by the desire to provide stable identifiers that may\n+be used by Bitcoin applications.\n+\n+== Description ==\n+\n+=== Design ===\n+\n+Every sat is serially numbered, starting at 0, in the order in which it is\n+mined. These numbers are termed \"ordinal numbers\", or \"ordinals\", as they are\n+ordinal numbers in the mathematical sense, giving the order of each sat in the\n+total supply. The word \"ordinal\" is nicely unambiguous, as it is not used\n+elsewhere in the Bitcoin protocol.\n+\n+The ordinal numbers of sats in transaction inputs are transferred to output\n+sats in first-in-first-out order, according to the size and order of the\n+transactions inputs and outputs.\n+\n+If a transaction is mined with the same transaction ID as outputs currently in\n+the UTXO set, following the behavior of Bitcoin Core, the new transaction\n+outputs displace the older UTXO set entries, destroying the sats contained in\n+any unspent outputs of the first transaction. This rule is required to handle\n+the two pairs of mainnet transactions with duplicate transaction IDs, namely\n+the coinbase transactions of blocks 91812/91842, and 91722/91880, mined before\n+[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki BIP-34] made\n+the creation of transactions with duplicate IDs impossible.\n+\n+For the purposes of the assignment algorithm, the coinbase transaction is\n+considered to have an implicit input equal in size to the subsidy, followed by\n+an input for every fee-paying transaction in the block, in the order that those\n+transactions appear in the block. The implicit subsidy input carries the\n+block's newly created sats. The implicit fee inputs carry the sats that were\n+paid as fees in the block's transactions.\n+\n+Underpaying the subsidy does not change the ordinal numbers of sats mined\n+in subsequent blocks. Ordinals depend only on how many sats could have been\n+mined, not how many actually were.\n+\n+=== Specification ===\n+\n+Sats are numbered and transferred with the following algorithm:\n+\n+<source lang=\"python\">\n+# subsidy of block at given height\n+def subsidy(height):\n+  return 50 * 100_000_000 >> height // 210_000\n+\n+# first ordinal of subsidy of block at given height\n+def first_ordinal(height):\n+  start = 0\n+  for height in range(height):\n+    start += subsidy(height)\n+  return start\n+\n+# assign ordinals in given block\n+def assign_ordinals(block):\n+  first = first_ordinal(block.height)\n+  last = first + subsidy(block.height)\n+  coinbase_ordinals = list(range(first, last))\n+\n+  for transaction in block.transactions[1:]:\n+    ordinals = []\n+    for input in transaction.inputs:\n+      ordinals.extend(input.ordinals)\n+\n+    for output in transaction.outputs:\n+      output.ordinals = ordinals[:output.value]\n+      del ordinals[:output.value]\n+\n+    coinbase_ordinals.extend(ordinals)\n+\n+  for output in block.transaction[0].outputs:\n+    output.ordinals = coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+    del coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+</source>\n+\n+A miner may underpay the block reward, in which case\n+<code>coinbase_ordinals</code> will not be empty when\n+<code>assign_ordinals</code> returns. These sats are lost and not assigned to\n+any output of the coinbase transaction.\n+\n+=== Terminology and Notation ===\n+\n+A satpoint may be used to indicate the location of a sat within an output. A\n+satpoint consists of an outpoint, i.e., a transaction ID and output index, with\n+the addition of the offset of the ordinal within that output. For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+<code>680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6</code>\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.\n+\n+''Congestion: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+transactions, and drive up fees.''\n+\n+Since Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong\n+positive of the proposal.\n+\n+''UTXO set bloat: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+entries in the UTXO set, and thus increase the size of the UTXO set, which all\n+full nodes are required to track.''\n+\n+The dust limit, which makes outputs with small values difficult to create,\n+should encourage users to create non-dust outputs, and to clean them up once\n+they no longer have use for the sats that they contain.\n+\n+=== Security ===\n+\n+The public key associated with a sat may change. This requires actively\n+following the blockchain to keep up with key changes, and requires care\n+compared to a system where public keys are static. However, a system with\n+static public keys suffers from an inability for keys to be rotated or accounts\n+to change hands.\n+\n+Ordinal-aware software must avoid losing valuable sats by unintentionally\n+relinquishing them in a transaction, either to a non-controlled output or by\n+using them as fees.\n+\n+=== Privacy considerations ===\n+\n+Ordinals are opt-in, and should not impact the privacy of existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals are themselves public, however, this is required by the fact that many\n+of the applications that they are intended to enable require public\n+identifiers.\n+\n+Ordinal aware software should never mix sats which might have some publicly\n+visible data associated with their ordinals with sats intended for use in\n+payments or savings, since this would associate that publicly visible data with\n+the users otherwise pseudonymous wallet outputs.\n+\n+=== Fungibility considerations ===\n+\n+Since any sat can be sent to any address at any time, sat that are transferred,\n+even those with some public history, should be considered to be fungible with\n+other sats with no such history.\n+\n+=== Backward compatibility ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are fully backwards compatible and require no changes to the\n+bitcoin network.\n+\n+=== Drawbacks ===\n+\n+==== Large Index Size ====\n+\n+Indexes supporting fast queries related to ordinals are slow to build and\n+consume large amounts of space.\n+\n+As of January, 2023, an O(1) index that maps UTXOs to the ordinals that they\n+contain is 100 GiB. The same index including spent outputs is 10 TiB.\n+\n+An O(1) index supporting the opposite mapping, that of individual ordinals to\n+the UTXO that contains them, is likely to be intractable. However, an O(n)\n+index where n is the number of times an ordinal has changed hands, is fast and\n+practical.\n+\n+==== Large Location Proofs ====\n+\n+A proof can be constructed that demonstrates that a particular sat is contained\n+in a particular output, however the proofs are large. Such a proof consists of:\n+\n+* Block headers\n+* A Merkle path to the coinbase transaction that created the sat\n+* The coinbase transaction that created the sat\n+* And for every spend of that sat:\n+** The spend transaction\n+** The transactions that created the inputs before the input that was spent, to determine the values of the preceding inputs, to determine the position of the sat\n+** And, if the sat was used as fees, all prior transaction in the block in which it was spent, and the coinbase transaction, to determine the location of the sat in the outputs.\n+\n+== Reference implementation ==\n+\n+This document and an implementation of an index that tracks the position of\n+sats in the main chain are maintained [https://github.com/casey/ord here].",

The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.\n+\n+''Congestion: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+transactions, and drive up fees.''\n+\n+Since Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong\n+positive of the proposal.\n+\n+''UTXO set bloat: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+entries in the UTXO set, and thus increase the size of the UTXO set, which all\n+full nodes are required to track.''\n+\n+The dust limit, which makes outputs with small values difficult to create,\n+should encourage users to create non-dust outputs, and to clean them up once\n+they no longer have use for the sats that they contain.\n+\n+=== Security ===\n+\n+The public key associated with a sat may change. This requires actively\n+following the blockchain to keep up with key changes, and requires care\n+compared to a system where public keys are static. However, a system with\n+static public keys suffers from an inability for keys to be rotated or accounts\n+to change hands.\n+\n+Ordinal-aware software must avoid losing valuable sats by unintentionally\n+relinquishing them in a transaction, either to a non-controlled output or by\n+using them as fees.\n+\n+=== Privacy considerations ===\n+\n+Ordinals are opt-in, and should not impact the privacy of existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals are themselves public, however, this is required by the fact that many\n+of the applications that they are intended to enable require public\n+identifiers.\n+\n+Ordinal aware software should never mix sats which might have some publicly\n+visible data associated with their ordinals with sats intended for use in\n+payments or savings, since this would associate that publicly visible data with\n+the users otherwise pseudonymous wallet outputs.\n+\n+=== Fungibility considerations ===\n+\n+Since any sat can be sent to any address at any time, sat that are transferred,",

The implicit subsidy input carries the\n+block's newly created sats. The implicit fee inputs carry the sats that were\n+paid as fees in the block's transactions.\n+\n+Underpaying the subsidy does not change the ordinal numbers of sats mined\n+in subsequent blocks. Ordinals depend only on how many sats could have been\n+mined, not how many actually were.\n+\n+=== Specification ===\n+\n+Sats are numbered and transferred with the following algorithm:\n+\n+<source lang=\"python\">\n+# subsidy of block at given height\n+def subsidy(height):\n+  return 50 * 100_000_000 >> height // 210_000\n+\n+# first ordinal of subsidy of block at given height\n+def first_ordinal(height):\n+  start = 0\n+  for height in range(height):\n+    start += subsidy(height)\n+  return start\n+\n+# assign ordinals in given block\n+def assign_ordinals(block):\n+  first = first_ordinal(block.height)\n+  last = first + subsidy(block.height)\n+  coinbase_ordinals = list(range(first, last))\n+\n+  for transaction in block.transactions[1:]:\n+    ordinals = []\n+    for input in transaction.inputs:\n+      ordinals.extend(input.ordinals)\n+\n+    for output in transaction.outputs:\n+      output.ordinals = ordinals[:output.value]\n+      del ordinals[:output.value]\n+\n+    coinbase_ordinals.extend(ordinals)\n+\n+  for output in block.transaction[0].outputs:\n+    output.ordinals = coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+    del coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+</source>\n+\n+A miner may underpay the block reward, in which case\n+<code>coinbase_ordinals</code> will not be empty when\n+<code>assign_ordinals</code> returns. These sats are lost and not assigned to\n+any output of the coinbase transaction.\n+\n+=== Terminology and Notation ===\n+\n+A satpoint may be used to indicate the location of a sat within an output. A\n+satpoint consists of an outpoint, i.e., a transaction ID and output index, with\n+the addition of the offset of the ordinal within that output. For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+<code>680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6</code>\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively.

Addresses are\n+single-use, and wallet accounts are private. Additionally, the use of addresses\n+or public keys as stable identifiers precludes transfer of ownership or key\n+rotation.\n+\n+This proposal is motivated by the desire to provide stable identifiers that may\n+be used by Bitcoin applications.\n+\n+== Description ==\n+\n+=== Design ===\n+\n+Every sat is serially numbered, starting at 0, in the order in which it is\n+mined. These numbers are termed \"ordinal numbers\", or \"ordinals\", as they are\n+ordinal numbers in the mathematical sense, giving the order of each sat in the\n+total supply. The word \"ordinal\" is nicely unambiguous, as it is not used\n+elsewhere in the Bitcoin protocol.\n+\n+The ordinal numbers of sats in transaction inputs are transferred to output\n+sats in first-in-first-out order, according to the size and order of the\n+transactions inputs and outputs.\n+\n+If a transaction is mined with the same transaction ID as outputs currently in\n+the UTXO set, following the behavior of Bitcoin Core, the new transaction\n+outputs displace the older UTXO set entries, destroying the sats contained in\n+any unspent outputs of the first transaction. This rule is required to handle\n+the two pairs of mainnet transactions with duplicate transaction IDs, namely\n+the coinbase transactions of blocks 91812/91842, and 91722/91880, mined before\n+[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki BIP-34] made\n+the creation of transactions with duplicate IDs impossible.\n+\n+For the purposes of the assignment algorithm, the coinbase transaction is\n+considered to have an implicit input equal in size to the subsidy, followed by\n+an input for every fee-paying transaction in the block, in the order that those\n+transactions appear in the block. The implicit subsidy input carries the\n+block's newly created sats. The implicit fee inputs carry the sats that were\n+paid as fees in the block's transactions.\n+\n+Underpaying the subsidy does not change the ordinal numbers of sats mined\n+in subsequent blocks. Ordinals depend only on how many sats could have been\n+mined, not how many actually were.\n+\n+=== Specification ===\n+\n+Sats are numbered and transferred with the following algorithm:\n+\n+<source lang=\"python\">\n+# subsidy of block at given height\n+def subsidy(height):\n+  return 50 * 100_000_000 >> height // 210_000\n+\n+# first ordinal of subsidy of block at given height\n+def first_ordinal(height):\n+  start = 0\n+  for height in range(height):\n+    start += subsidy(height)\n+  return start\n+\n+# assign ordinals in given block\n+def assign_ordinals(block):\n+  first = first_ordinal(block.height)\n+  last = first + subsidy(block.height)\n+  coinbase_ordinals = list(range(first, last))\n+\n+  for transaction in block.transactions[1:]:\n+    ordinals = []\n+    for input in transaction.inputs:\n+      ordinals.extend(input.ordinals)\n+\n+    for output in transaction.outputs:\n+      output.ordinals = ordinals[:output.value]\n+      del ordinals[:output.value]\n+\n+    coinbase_ordinals.extend(ordinals)\n+\n+  for output in block.transaction[0].outputs:\n+    output.ordinals = coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+    del coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+</source>\n+\n+A miner may underpay the block reward, in which case\n+<code>coinbase_ordinals</code> will not be empty when\n+<code>assign_ordinals</code> returns. These sats are lost and not assigned to\n+any output of the coinbase transaction.\n+\n+=== Terminology and Notation ===\n+\n+A satpoint may be used to indicate the location of a sat within an output. A\n+satpoint consists of an outpoint, i.e., a transaction ID and output index, with\n+the addition of the offset of the ordinal within that output. For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+<code>680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6</code>\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.\n+\n+''Congestion: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+transactions, and drive up fees.''\n+\n+Since Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong\n+positive of the proposal.\n+\n+''UTXO set bloat: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+entries in the UTXO set, and thus increase the size of the UTXO set, which all\n+full nodes are required to track.''\n+\n+The dust limit, which makes outputs with small values difficult to create,\n+should encourage users to create non-dust outputs, and to clean them up once\n+they no longer have use for the sats that they contain.\n+\n+=== Security ===\n+\n+The public key associated with a sat may change.

These sats are lost and not assigned to\n+any output of the coinbase transaction.\n+\n+=== Terminology and Notation ===\n+\n+A satpoint may be used to indicate the location of a sat within an output. A\n+satpoint consists of an outpoint, i.e., a transaction ID and output index, with\n+the addition of the offset of the ordinal within that output. For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+<code>680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6</code>\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+the new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the previous\n+owner, or have any particular relationship with the previous owner.\n+\n+''Congestion: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+transactions, and drive up fees.''\n+\n+Since Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong\n+positive of the proposal.\n+\n+''UTXO set bloat: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+entries in the UTXO set, and thus increase the size of the UTXO set, which all\n+full nodes are required to track.''\n+\n+The dust limit, which makes outputs with small values difficult to create,\n+should encourage users to create non-dust outputs, and to clean them up once\n+they no longer have use for the sats that they contain.\n+\n+=== Security ===\n+\n+The public key associated with a sat may change. This requires actively\n+following the blockchain to keep up with key changes, and requires care\n+compared to a system where public keys are static. However, a system with\n+static public keys suffers from an inability for keys to be rotated or accounts\n+to change hands.\n+\n+Ordinal-aware software must avoid losing valuable sats by unintentionally\n+relinquishing them in a transaction, either to a non-controlled output or by\n+using them as fees.\n+\n+=== Privacy considerations ===\n+\n+Ordinals are opt-in, and should not impact the privacy of existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals are themselves public, however, this is required by the fact that many\n+of the applications that they are intended to enable require public\n+identifiers.\n+\n+Ordinal aware software should never mix sats which might have some publicly\n+visible data associated with their ordinals with sats intended for use in\n+payments or savings, since this would associate that publicly visible data with\n+the users otherwise pseudonymous wallet outputs.\n+\n+=== Fungibility considerations ===\n+\n+Since any sat can be sent to any address at any time, sats that are\n+transferred, even those with some public history, should be considered to be\n+fungible with other sats with no such history.\n+\n+=== Backward compatibility ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are fully backwards compatible and require no changes to the\n+bitcoin network.\n+\n+=== Drawbacks ===\n+\n+==== Large Index Size ====\n+\n+Indexes supporting fast queries related to ordinals are slow to build and\n+consume large amounts of space.\n+\n+As of September, 2024, an O(1) index that maps UTXOs to the ordinals that they\n+contain is 93 GiB.\n+\n+An O(1) index supporting the opposite mapping, that of individual ordinals to\n+the UTXO that contains them, is likely to be intractable. However, an O(n)\n+index where n is the number of times an ordinal has changed hands, is fast and\n+practical.\n+\n+==== Large Location Proofs ====\n+\n+A proof can be constructed that demonstrates that a particular sat is contained\n+in a particular output, however the proofs are large. Such a proof consists of:\n+\n+* Block headers\n+* A Merkle path to the coinbase transaction that created the sat\n+* The coinbase transaction that created the sat\n+* And for every spend of that sat:\n+** The spend transaction\n+** The transactions that created the inputs before the input that was spent, to determine the values of the preceding inputs, to determine the position of the sat\n+** And, if the sat was used as fees, all prior transaction in the block in which it was spent, and the coinbase transaction, to determine the location of the sat in the outputs.\n+\n+== Reference implementation ==\n+\n+This document and an implementation of an index that tracks the position of\n+sats in the main chain are maintained [https://github.com/casey/ord here].\n+\n+== References ==\n+\n+A variation of this scheme was independently invented a decade ago by jl2012\n+[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=117224.0 on the Bitcoin Forum].\n+\n+For other colored coin proposals see [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Colored_Coins\n+the Bitcoin Wiki entry].",

Addresses are\n+single-use, and wallet accounts are private. Additionally, the use of addresses\n+or public keys as stable identifiers precludes transfer of ownership or key\n+rotation.\n+\n+This proposal is motivated by the desire to provide stable identifiers that may\n+be used by Bitcoin applications.\n+\n+== Description ==\n+\n+=== Design ===\n+\n+Every sat is serially numbered, starting at 0, in the order in which it is\n+mined. These numbers are termed \"ordinal numbers\", or \"ordinals\", as they are\n+ordinal numbers in the mathematical sense, giving the order of each sat in the\n+total supply. The word \"ordinal\" is nicely unambiguous, as it is not used\n+elsewhere in the Bitcoin protocol.\n+\n+The ordinal numbers of sats in transaction inputs are transferred to output\n+sats in first-in-first-out order, according to the size and order of the\n+transactions inputs and outputs.\n+\n+If a transaction is mined with the same transaction ID as outputs currently in\n+the UTXO set, following the behavior of Bitcoin Core, the new transaction\n+outputs displace the older UTXO set entries, destroying the sats contained in\n+any unspent outputs of the first transaction. This rule is required to handle\n+the two pairs of mainnet transactions with duplicate transaction IDs, namely\n+the coinbase transactions of blocks 91812/91842, and 91722/91880, mined before\n+[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki BIP-34] made\n+the creation of transactions with duplicate IDs impossible.\n+\n+For the purposes of the assignment algorithm, the coinbase transaction is\n+considered to have an implicit input equal in size to the subsidy, followed by\n+an input for every fee-paying transaction in the block, in the order that those\n+transactions appear in the block. The implicit subsidy input carries the\n+block's newly created sats. The implicit fee inputs carry the sats that were\n+paid as fees in the block's transactions.\n+\n+Underpaying the subsidy does not change the ordinal numbers of sats mined\n+in subsequent blocks. Ordinals depend only on how many sats could have been\n+mined, not how many actually were.\n+\n+=== Specification ===\n+\n+Sats are numbered and transferred with the following algorithm:\n+\n+<source lang=\"python\">\n+# subsidy of block at given height\n+def subsidy(height):\n+  return 50 * 100_000_000 >> height // 210_000\n+\n+# first ordinal of subsidy of block at given height\n+def first_ordinal(height):\n+  start = 0\n+  for height in range(height):\n+    start += subsidy(height)\n+  return start\n+\n+# assign ordinals in given block\n+def assign_ordinals(block):\n+  first = first_ordinal(block.height)\n+  last = first + subsidy(block.height)\n+  coinbase_ordinals = list(range(first, last))\n+\n+  for transaction in block.transactions[1:]:\n+    ordinals = []\n+    for input in transaction.inputs:\n+      ordinals.extend(input.ordinals)\n+\n+    for output in transaction.outputs:\n+      output.ordinals = ordinals[:output.value]\n+      del ordinals[:output.value]\n+\n+    coinbase_ordinals.extend(ordinals)\n+\n+  for output in block.transaction[0].outputs:\n+    output.ordinals = coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+    del coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+</source>\n+\n+A miner may underpay the block reward, in which case\n+<code>coinbase_ordinals</code> will not be empty when\n+<code>assign_ordinals</code> returns. These sats are lost and not assigned to\n+any output of the coinbase transaction.\n+\n+=== Terminology and Notation ===\n+\n+A satpoint may be used to indicate the location of a sat within an output. A\n+satpoint consists of an outpoint, i.e., a transaction ID and output index, with\n+the addition of the offset of the ordinal within that output. For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+<code>680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6</code>\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+the new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the previous\n+owner, or have any particular relationship with the previous owner.\n+\n+''Congestion: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+transactions, and drive up fees.''\n+\n+Since Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong\n+positive of the proposal.\n+\n+''UTXO set bloat: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+entries in the UTXO set, and thus increase the size of the UTXO set, which all\n+full nodes are required to track.''\n+\n+The dust limit, which makes outputs with small values difficult to create,\n+should encourage users to create non-dust outputs, and to clean them up once\n+they no longer have use for the sats that they contain.\n+\n+=== Security ===\n+\n+The public key associated with a sat may change. This requires actively\n+following the blockchain to keep up with key changes, and requires care\n+compared to a system where public keys are static. However, a system with\n+static public keys suffers from an inability for keys to be rotated or accounts\n+to change hands.\n+\n+Ordinal-aware software must avoid losing valuable sats by unintentionally\n+relinquishing them in a transaction, either to a non-controlled output or by\n+using them as fees.\n+\n+=== Privacy considerations ===\n+\n+Ordinals are opt-in, and should not impact the privacy of existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals are themselves public, however, this is required by the fact that many\n+of the applications that they are intended to enable require public\n+identifiers.\n+\n+Ordinal aware software should never mix sats which might have some publicly\n+visible data associated with their ordinals with sats intended for use in\n+payments or savings, since this would associate that publicly visible data with\n+the users otherwise pseudonymous wallet outputs.\n+\n+=== Fungibility considerations ===\n+\n+Since any sat can be sent to any address at any time, sats that are\n+transferred, even those with some public history, should be considered to be\n+fungible with other sats with no such history.\n+\n+=== Backward compatibility ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are fully backwards compatible and require no changes to the\n+bitcoin network.\n+\n+=== Drawbacks ===\n+\n+==== Large Index Size ====\n+\n+Indexes supporting fast queries related to ordinals are slow to build and\n+consume large amounts of space.\n+\n+As of September, 2024, an O(1) index that maps UTXOs to the ordinals that they\n+contain is 93 GiB.\n+\n+An O(1) index supporting the opposite mapping, that of individual ordinals to\n+the UTXO that contains them, is likely to be intractable. However, an O(n)\n+index where n is the number of times an ordinal has changed hands, is fast and\n+practical.\n+\n+==== Large Location Proofs ====\n+\n+A proof can be constructed that demonstrates that a particular sat is contained\n+in a particular output, however the proofs are large. Such a proof consists of:\n+\n+* Block headers\n+* A Merkle path to the coinbase transaction that created the sat\n+* The coinbase transaction that created the sat\n+* And for every spend of that sat:\n+** The spend transaction\n+** The transactions that created the inputs before the input that was spent, to determine the values of the preceding inputs, to determine the position of the sat\n+** And, if the sat was used as fees, all prior transaction in the block in which it was spent, and the coinbase transaction, to determine the location of the sat in the outputs.\n+\n+== Reference implementation ==\n+\n+This document and an implementation of an index that tracks the position of\n+sats in the main chain are maintained [https://github.com/casey/ord here].\n+\n+== References ==",
