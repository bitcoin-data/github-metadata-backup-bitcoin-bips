          "body": "This PR implements BIP 325 (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0325.mediawiki) -- Signet support.\r\n\r\n**Note:** This PR is being split into more bite-sized PR's, the first of which is #18267.\r\n\r\nMerged check boxes:\r\n* [ ] Signet consensus: #18267\r\n* [ ] Signet RPC tools: pending consensus merge\r\n* [ ] Signet utility scripts (contrib/signet): pending RPC tool merge\r\n\r\nSignet is a proposed new type of test network that requires a signature in the blocks. While this kind of network is centralized, it allows for properties that are desirable in a test network, which testnet alone cannot provide.\r\n\r\nSignet has a default global testnet baked in for easy usage, but is built around the concept of there being multiple simultaneous signets. Someone is already working on a signet with bip-taproot etc patched on top of it. When new features are tested globally, starting a temporary signet for that purpose is trivial.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Signet\r\n\r\nNoteworthy:\r\n* ~~proof of work check now skips genesis block for all networks, including mainnet~~\r\n* a new global \"is signet\" flag is added, which affects consensus: it adds a new enforcement that all blocks must have a valid signature for the \"signet block script\", a global script\r\n* `DecodeHexBlk` will now attempt to load the block data from a file whose filename is the hex string argument, if it turns out to not be a valid hex string; this has the odd caveat of the relative directory being relative to the execution of `bitcoind`, not `bitcoin-cli` (see `contrib/signet/mkblock.sh`)\r\n\r\nUpdate: proof of work check is back in place; instead, Signet now requires an additional `-signet_genesisnonce` parameter to operate.",

For more details, please see the [Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Signet) & [mailing-list announement](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-July/017123.html) & [BIP on github](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/803).\r\n\r\n### Advantages\r\n\r\n- Controllable block time\r\n- Controllable events like rollbacks, forks and double spends\r\n- New, thus less blocks\r\n- Easier to create independent and project specific Signet [already work done for a taproot signet]\r\n- Easier to test applications in multi user environments\r\n\r\n### Rational\r\n\r\nWasabi already supports `mainnet` & `testnet v3` & `regtest`, so why not add this latest network? It seems that `signet` solves many problems, and there is promise that it will \"replace\" `testnet v3` as best place to test stuff. \r\n\r\nWasabi has the opportunity to, again, pioneer cutting edge Bitcoin tools and help the tribe to emerge solid standards.",

I think the \"is this bitcoin\" discussion is a valid point but also I think there's wide enough agreement that this deserves a BIP [as a testnet, not as a future course for bitcoin mainnet, ofc]. There's much more controversial ideas (for mainnet!) that got a BIP number.\r\n\r\n*looks at BIP100 onward*\r\n\r\nYup. We've had many more \"is this Bitcoin?\" BIPs merged with the intent of hardforking mainnet... so a BIP with the intent of creating a new testnet is definitely BIP-worthy imo.",

Huge block reorgs, long gaps in between blocks being mined or sudden bursts of blocks in rapid succession mean that realistic testing of software, especially involving multiple independent parties running software over an extended period of time, becomes infeasible in practice.\n+\n+A new type of test network would be more suitable for integration testing by organizations such as exchanges, or testing of next generation Layer-2 protocols like Eltoo or sidechain pegs. The goal is not to be perfectly reliable but rather to have a predictable amount of unreliability. You want a test network to behave like mainnet (i.e. no thousands of block reorgs) while also making it easier to trigger expected but rare events like a 6-block reorg. Regtest is not suitable for longer-term scenarios involving multiple independent parties because creating blocks costs nothing, so any party can completely control the test network.\n+\n+\n+== Specification ==\n+\n+A new type of network (\"signet\"), which takes an additional consensus parameter called the challenge (scriptPubKey). The challenge can be a simple pubkey (P2PKH style), or a k-of-n multisig, or any other script you would want.\n+\n+The witness commitment of the coinbase transaction is extended to include a secondary commitment (the signature/solution):\n+\n+    1-4 bytes - Push the following (x + 4) bytes\n+    4 bytes - Signet header (0xecc7daa2)\n+    x bytes - Solution (sigScript)\n+\n+Any push operations that do not start with the 4 byte signet header are ignored. Multiple push operations with the 4 byte signet header are ignored except for the first entry.\n+\n+Any signature operations contained within the challenge use SHA256d(modifiedBlockHash), i.e. the double-SHA256 digest of the following data as the sighash:\n+\n+{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n+|-\n+!Type\n+!Size\n+!Name\n+|-\n+|Int32||4||nVersion\n+|-\n+|Uint256||32||hashPrevBlock\n+|-\n+|Uint256||32||modifiedMerkleRoot\n+|-\n+|Uint32||4||nTime\n+|-\n+|Uint32||4||nBits\n+|}\n+\n+The <code>modifiedMerkleRoot</code> hash is obtained by generating the merkle root of the block transactions, with the coinbase witness commitment as is, without the signet extension. This means the merkle root of the block is different from the merkle root in the signet commitment, but in return, the block nonce value is the only component that the signet signature does not commit to. When grinding proof of work, the extended nonce cannot be used as it would invalidate the signature. Instead, simply resigning the same (or an updated) block will give a new search space.\n+\n+A block is considered fully validated if the above commitment is found, and its solution is valid. This verification should be done directly before or after the witness commitment verification.",
