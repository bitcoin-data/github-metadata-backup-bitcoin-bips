Since nonces must not be reused, this PR holds them exclusively in memory, so a restart of the software will require a restart of the MuSig2 signing process. Additionally, the current MuSig API in libsecp basically involves us holding onto and passing around an opaque libsecp object. There may be some additional work there to make the code more ergonomic.",

      "body": "> I've made a minor change with the descriptors regarding sorting. Keys in a `musig()` can be specified in any order, but will be sorted prior to aggregation, similar to `sortedmulti()`. However for PSBTs, keys must be supplied in the expected order for aggregation (this is unchanged), which means sorting them if they weren't already.\r\n\r\nWhat is the rationale for this change? It seems to me that this complicates parsing/processing the descriptor unnecessarily. The only practical advantage I know of `sortedmulti` versus `multi` is that with `multi` an external observer can possibly fingerprint who signed different UTXOs even without knowing the descriptor; but that's not the case anyway for `musig`.",

Since BIP 327 suggests to do sorting, we decided it made sense to do in descriptors as well.\r\n\r\nBIP 327 discusses the possibility of sorting and describes a canonical sorting, but I didn't read it as 'suggesting' one way or another.\r\n\r\nIn general, I'd prefer maximum simplicity and less chances of malleability in descriptors, and this imho goes against both (albeit slightly, not a huge deal).\r\n\r\nNote that this removes functionality, as one of $n! - 1$ of the $n!$ possible combinations become inexpressible with descriptors.",

However, as the best practice is to use a new address for every payment,\n+it is necessary for the cosigners of a single aggregate pubkey to have a way to produce additional\n+aggregate pubkeys.\n+\n+The obvious method is for the cosigners to generate multiple public keys and produce a\n+new aggregate pubkey every time one is needed. This is similar to how multisig using Bitcoin script\n+works where all of the cosigners share their extended public keys and do derivation to produce\n+the multisig script. The same could be done with MuSig2 and instead of producing a multisig script,\n+the result would be a MuSig2 aggregate pubkey.\n+\n+However, it is much simpler to be able to derive from a single extended public key instead of having\n+to derive from many extended public keys and aggregate them. As MuSig2 produces a normal looking\n+public key, the aggregate public can be used in this way. This reduces the storage and computation\n+requirements for generating new aggregate pubkeys.",

However, as the best practice is to use a new address for every payment,\n+it is necessary for the cosigners of a single aggregate pubkey to have a way to produce additional\n+aggregate pubkeys.\n+\n+The obvious method is for the cosigners to generate multiple public keys and produce a\n+new aggregate pubkey every time one is needed. This is similar to how multisig using Bitcoin script\n+works where all of the cosigners share their extended public keys and do derivation to produce\n+the multisig script. The same could be done with MuSig2 and instead of producing a multisig script,\n+the result would be a MuSig2 aggregate pubkey.\n+\n+However, it is much simpler to be able to derive from a single extended public key instead of having\n+to derive from many extended public keys and aggregate them. As MuSig2 produces a normal looking\n+public key, the aggregate public can be used in this way. This reduces the storage and computation\n+requirements for generating new aggregate pubkeys.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+A synthetic xpub can be created from a BIP 327 MuSig2 plain aggregate public key by setting\n+the depth to 0, the child number to 0, and attaching a chaincode with the byte string\n+<tt>868087ca02a6f974c4598924c36b57762d32cb45717167e300622c7167e38965</tt><ref>'''Where does this\n+constant chaincode come from?''' It is the SHA256 of the text <tt>MuSig2MuSig2MuSig2</tt></ref>.\n+This fixed chaincode should be used by all such synthetic xpubs following this specification.\n+Unhardend child public keys can be derived from the synthetic xpub as with any other xpub.",

However, as the best practice is to use a new address for every payment,\n+it is necessary for the cosigners of a single aggregate pubkey to have a way to produce additional\n+aggregate pubkeys.\n+\n+The obvious method is for the cosigners to generate multiple public keys and produce a\n+new aggregate pubkey every time one is needed. This is similar to how multisig using Bitcoin script\n+works where all of the cosigners share their extended public keys and do derivation to produce\n+the multisig script. The same could be done with MuSig2 and instead of producing a multisig script,\n+the result would be a MuSig2 aggregate pubkey.\n+\n+However, it is much simpler to be able to derive from a single extended public key instead of having\n+to derive from many extended public keys and aggregate them. As MuSig2 produces a normal looking\n+public key, the aggregate public can be used in this way. This reduces the storage and computation\n+requirements for generating new aggregate pubkeys.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+A synthetic xpub can be created from a BIP 327 MuSig2 plain aggregate public key by setting\n+the depth to 0, the child number to 0, and attaching a chaincode with the byte string\n+<tt>868087ca02a6f974c4598924c36b57762d32cb45717167e300622c7167e38965</tt><ref>'''Where does this\n+constant chaincode come from?''' It is the SHA256 of the text <tt>MuSig2MuSig2MuSig2</tt></ref>.\n+This fixed chaincode should be used by all such synthetic xpubs following this specification.\n+Unhardend child public keys can be derived from the synthetic xpub as with any other xpub.",

      "body": "After talking about this again with @sipa, the conclusion is that philosophically, MuSig2 operates over a set of keys, so the order should not matter. For serialization as an implementation detail, it does, so having it sorted is a logical order for an ostensibly unordered set.\r\n\r\nAnother argument for sorting is to make the recovery process easier,. As we know from multisig usage that exists currently, users are often surprised to learn that they had to know more than just their key and their cosigners. By sorting, we can eliminate this as a concern. Ostensibly, users should be backing up their descriptors, but in practice, especially with the prevalance of hardware signers which espouse that only the seed needs to be backed up, I don't think that's something that happens that often.",

However, as the best practice is to use a new address for every payment,\n+it is necessary for the cosigners of a single aggregate pubkey to have a way to produce additional\n+aggregate pubkeys.",
