You could update the specification to announce \"SENDTEMPLATE 2\" indicating you support v2, which indicates to your peers they can send you a \"GETTEMPLATE 2\" message requesting a 2MvB template rather than a 1MvB template, eg.\r\n\r\nLikewise sending set differences through could make sense (and wouldn't need the complexity of minisketch since the sender knows their own previous templates), but there's still a lot of design space left, so getting real-world data also seems useful for resolving that. (Likewise an updated spec could allow `SENDTEMPLATE 2D` to indicate deltas are supported, and `GETTEMPLATE 2 $hash` could request a 2MvB template encoded as a delta against the previous template with hash `$hash`)",
