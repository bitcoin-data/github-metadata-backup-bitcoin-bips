I've heard a few people say that we should be able to evaluate code on its merits in spite of its author's personality. That's something I'd like to be on the side of, but things like this complicate the ability to defend that position.\r\n\r\nIf this code is not tied to the entirety of your ideas and opinions and stands on its own with its own merits as I believe it does, then this PR to remove it holds no weight.",
