      "body": "@kristovatlas to quote @petertodd from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2340\n\n> The more important reason is to discourage \"fee sniping\" by deliberately mining blocks that orphan the current best block. Basically for a large miner the value of the transactions in the best block and the mempool can exceed the cost of deliberately attempting to mine two blocks to orphan the best block. However with nLockTime you'll soon run out of transactions you can put in the first block, which means they now need to go in the second. With limited block sizes you're run out of room, and additionally another miner now only needs to orphan one block to in-turn snipe the high-fee transactions you had to place in the second block, wrecking all your hard work.\n\n_TL;DR_: stop miners attempting to orphan current blocks in an attempt to increase their fee subsidy reward,  enforced by transactions setting their 'minimum' inclusion time as the current block height.\n\nHow that is relevant to this BIP is that it does mean transactions are more easily recognized due to `nLockTime` being set to `activeChain.Height() + 1` (the next block).\n",

I already spent a long time editing the BIP based on prior feedback and I'm not really interested in spending more editing for the sake of succinctness, which comes with trade-offs. When I interacted with open source contributors to wallets on this topic, I found that they primarily wanted more detail about the scheme and not less. Keep in mind that the audience for BIPs is not necessarily restricted to people who religiously read the dev mailing list -- not that you are suggesting this, it's just a helpful reference point.\n",

      "body": "@kristovatlas if possible,  I'd prefer to stay away from heresay,  as,  in my experience,  I've only heard the opposite in regards to developer opinion on this BIP. \n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/157#discussion_r36488055 does not make any sense [to me],  although it seems well intentioned,  I can't imagine why you have accounted for it,  could you clarify that?\n\nThe BIP is currently a very long explanation for the following algorithm (pseudocode):\n\n``` javascript\ninputs.sort((a, b) => {\n  return compare(a.txHash, b.txHash, 32) || a.vout - b.vout\n})\n\noutputs.sort((a, b) => {\n  return a.value - b.value || compare(a.script, b.script, MIN(a.script.length, b.script.length))\n})\n```\n\nWhere `compare` is just a standard lexicographical comparison function, of which there are numerous examples you could give before giving a full python implementation as listed above.\n- `std::lexicographical_compare` in [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/lexicographical_compare/)\n- `cmp` in Python 2.7\n- `memcmp` in C\n\nVery easy to find,  very easy to [research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order).\nAlmost always pointless to re-implement,  or even give a pseudo-algorithm for.\n\nI'd really like to see this BIP get through, but as an open source library implementer, it took me more time to decipher the paragraphs behind this BIP than it did to write the [~20 line `npm` module](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bip69/blob/master/index.js).\n\nI'm not trying to be hostile,  I'm genuinely just trying to improve the ecosystem,  so please don't take these comments the wrong way.\n",

      "diff_hunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,134 @@\n+<pre>\n+  BIP:     BIP: 69\n+  Title:   Lexicographical Indexing of Transaction Inputs and Outputs\n+  Authors: Kristov Atlas <kristov@openbitcoinprivacyproject.org>\n+  Status:  Draft\n+  Type:    Informational\n+  Created: 2015-06-12\n+</pre>\n+\n+==Abstract==\n+\n+Currently there is no standard for bitcoin wallet clients when ordering transaction inputs and outputs. As a result, wallet clients often have a discernible blockchain fingerprint, and can leak private information about their users. By contrast, a standard for non-deterministic sorting could be difficult to audit. This document proposes deterministic lexicographical sorting, using hashes of previous transactions and output indices to sort transaction inputs, as well as values and scriptPubKeys to sort transaction outputs.\n+\n+==Copyright==\n+\n+This BIP is in the public domain.\n+\n+==Motivation==\n+\n+Currently, there is no clear standard for how wallet clients ought to order transaction inputs and outputs. Since wallet clients are left to their own devices to determine this ordering, they often leak information about their users’ finances. For example, a wallet client might naively order inputs based on when addresses were added to a wallet by the user through importing or random generation. Many wallets will place spending outputs first and change outputs second, leaking information about both the sender and receiver’s finances to passive blockchain observers. Such information should remain private not only for the benefit of consumers, but in higher order financial systems must be kept secret to prevent fraud. A researcher recently demonstrated this principle when he detected that Bitstamp leaked information when creating exchange transactions, enabling potential espionage among traders. [1]\n+\n+One way to address these privacy weaknesses is by randomly ordering inputs and outputs. [2] After all, the order of inputs and outputs does not impact the function of the transaction they belong to, making random sorting viable. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to prove that this sorting process is genuinely randomly sorted based on code or run-time analysis, especially if the software is closed source. A malicious software developer can abuse the ordering of inputs and outputs as a side channel of leaking information. For example, if an attacker can patch a victim’s HD wallet client to order inputs and outputs based on the bits of a master private key, then the attacker can eventually steal all of the victim’s funds by monitoring the blockchain. Non-deterministic methods of sorting are difficult to audit because they are not repeatable.\n+\n+The lack of standardization between wallet clients when ordering inputs and outputs can yield predictable quirks that characterize particular wallet clients or services. Such quirks create unique fingerprints that a privacy attacker can employ through simple passive blockchain observation.\n+\n+The solution is to create an algorithm for sorting transaction inputs and outputs that is deterministic. Since it is deterministic, it should also be unambiguous — that is, given a particular transaction, the proper order of inputs and outputs should be obvious. To make this standard as widely applicable as possible, it should rely on information that is downloaded by both full nodes (with or without typical efficiency techniques such as pruning) and SPV nodes. In order to ensure that it does not leak confidential data, it must rely on information that is publicly accessible through the blockchain. The use of public blockchain information also allows a transaction to be sorted even when it is a multi-party transaction, such as in the example of a CoinJoin.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+===Applicability===\n+\n+This BIP applies to any transaction for which the order of its inputs and outputs does not impact the transaction’s function. Currently, this refers to any transaction that employs the SIGHASH_ALL signature hash type, in which signatures commit to the exact order of inputs and outputs. Transactions that use SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY and/or SIGHASH_NONE may include inputs and/or outputs that are not signed; however, compliant software should still emit transactions with lexicographically sorted inputs and outputs, even though they may later be modified by others.\n+\n+In the event that future protocol upgrades introduce new signature hash types, compliant software should apply the lexicographical ordering principle analogously.\n+\n+While out of scope of this BIP, protocols that do require a specified order of inputs/outputs (e.g. due to use of SIGHASH_SINGLE) should consider the goals of this BIP and how best to adapt them to the specific needs of those protocols.\n+\n+===Lexicographical Sorting===\n+\n+Ordering of inputs and outputs will rely on the output of sorting functions. These functions can be defined as taking two inputs or two outputs as parameters and returning their appropriate ordering with respect to each other.\n+\n+Byte arrays must be sorted with an algorithm that produces the same output as the following comparison algorithm:\n+\n+ <nowiki>#returns -1 if barr1 is lesser, 1 if barr1 is greater, and 0 if equal\n+ def bytearr_cmp(barr1, barr2):\n+    pos = 0\n+    while (pos < len(barr1) and pos < len(barr2)):\n+        if (barr1[pos] < barr2[pos]):\n+            return -1;\n+        elif (barr1[pos] > barr2[pos]):\n+            return 1;\n+        pos = pos + 1\n+    #the shorter array will be ordered first\n+    if (len(barr1) < len(barr2)):\n+        return -1\n+    elif (len(barr1) > len(barr2)):\n+        return 1\n+    else:\n+        return 0</nowiki>\n+\n+N.B. These comparisons do not need to operate in constant time since they are not processing secret information.\n+\n+===Transaction Inputs===\n+\n+104\tTransaction inputs are defined by the hash of a previous transaction, the output index of of a UTXO from that previous transaction, the size of an unlocking script, the unlocking script, and a sequence number. [3] For sorting inputs, the hash of the previous transaction and the output index within that transaction are sufficient for sorting purposes; each transaction hash has an extremely high probability of being unique in the blockchain — this is enforced for coinbase transactions by BIP30 — and output indices within a transaction are unique. For the sake of efficiency, transaction hashes should be compared first before output indices, since output indices from different transactions are often equivalent, while all bytes of the transaction hash are effectively random variables.\n+\n+Hashes of previous transactions are considered for the purposes of this BIP in their little-endian, byte array format in order to match the traditional, human-readable string representation of the hashes. They must be sorted in accordance with the output of the bytearr_cmp() function above: the hash with the earliest lesser byte is ordered first, and shorter hashes are ordered before longer ones as a tie-breaker. In the event of two matching transaction hashes, output indices will be compared based on their integer value, with the smaller value ordered first. A further tie is extremely improbable for the aforementioned reasons.\n+\n+Because the hash of previous transactions and output indices must be included in a signed transaction, wallet clients capable of signing transactions will necessarily have access to this data.\n+\n+Transaction malleability will not negatively impact the correctness of this process. Even if a wallet client follows this process using unconfirmed UTXOs as inputs and an attacker changes modifies the blockchain’s record of the hash of the previous transaction, the wallet client will include the invalidated previous transaction hash in its input data, and will still correctly sort with respect to that invalidated hash.",

A malicious software developer can abuse the ordering of inputs and outputs as a side channel of leaking information. For example, if an attacker can patch a victim’s HD wallet client to order inputs and outputs based on the bits of a master private key, then the attacker can eventually steal all of the victim’s funds by monitoring the blockchain.

Since it is deterministic, it should also be unambiguous — that is, given a particular transaction, the proper order of inputs and outputs should be obvious. To make this standard as widely applicable as possible, it should rely on information that is downloaded by both full nodes (with or without typical efficiency techniques such as pruning) and SPV nodes. In order to ensure that it does not leak confidential data, it must rely on information that is publicly accessible through the blockchain.

As a result, wallet clients often have a discernible blockchain fingerprint, and can leak private information about their users. By contrast, a standard for non-deterministic sorting could be difficult to audit. This document proposes deterministic lexicographical sorting, using hashes of previous transactions and output indices to sort transaction inputs, as well as values and scriptPubKeys to sort transaction outputs.\n+\n+==Copyright==\n+\n+This BIP is in the public domain.\n+\n+==Motivation==\n+\n+Currently, there is no clear standard for how wallet clients ought to order transaction inputs and outputs. Since wallet clients are left to their own devices to determine this ordering, they often leak information about their users’ finances. For example, a wallet client might naively order inputs based on when addresses were added to a wallet by the user through importing or random generation. Many wallets will place spending outputs first and change outputs second, leaking information about both the sender and receiver’s finances to passive blockchain observers. Such information should remain private not only for the benefit of consumers, but in higher order financial systems must be kept secret to prevent fraud. A researcher recently demonstrated this principle when he detected that Bitstamp leaked information when creating exchange transactions, enabling potential espionage among traders. [1]\n+\n+One way to address these privacy weaknesses is by randomly ordering inputs and outputs. [2] After all, the order of inputs and outputs does not impact the function of the transaction they belong to, making random sorting viable. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to prove that this sorting process is genuinely randomly sorted based on code or run-time analysis, especially if the software is closed source. A malicious software developer can abuse the ordering of inputs and outputs as a side channel of leaking information. For example, if an attacker can patch a victim’s HD wallet client to order inputs and outputs based on the bits of a master private key, then the attacker can eventually steal all of the victim’s funds by monitoring the blockchain. Non-deterministic methods of sorting are difficult to audit because they are not repeatable.\n+\n+The lack of standardization between wallet clients when ordering inputs and outputs can yield predictable quirks that characterize particular wallet clients or services. Such quirks create unique fingerprints that a privacy attacker can employ through simple passive blockchain observation.\n+\n+The solution is to create an algorithm for sorting transaction inputs and outputs that is deterministic. Since it is deterministic, it should also be unambiguous — that is, given a particular transaction, the proper order of inputs and outputs should be obvious. To make this standard as widely applicable as possible, it should rely on information that is downloaded by both full nodes (with or without typical efficiency techniques such as pruning) and SPV nodes. In order to ensure that it does not leak confidential data, it must rely on information that is publicly accessible through the blockchain. The use of public blockchain information also allows a transaction to be sorted even when it is a multi-party transaction, such as in the example of a CoinJoin.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+===Applicability===\n+\n+This BIP applies to any transaction for which the order of its inputs and outputs does not impact the transaction’s function. Currently, this refers to any transaction that employs the SIGHASH_ALL signature hash type, in which signatures commit to the exact order of inputs and outputs. Transactions that use SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY and/or SIGHASH_NONE may include inputs and/or outputs that are not signed; however, compliant software should still emit transactions with lexicographically sorted inputs and outputs, even though they may later be modified by others.\n+\n+In the event that future protocol upgrades introduce new signature hash types, compliant software should apply the lexicographical ordering principle analogously.\n+\n+While out of scope of this BIP, protocols that do require a specified order of inputs/outputs (e.g. due to use of SIGHASH_SINGLE) should consider the goals of this BIP and how best to adapt them to the specific needs of those protocols.\n+\n+===Lexicographical Sorting===\n+\n+Ordering of inputs and outputs will rely on the output of sorting functions. These functions can be defined as taking two inputs or two outputs as parameters and returning their appropriate ordering with respect to each other.\n+\n+Byte arrays must be sorted with an algorithm that produces the same output as the following comparison algorithm:\n+\n+ <nowiki>#returns -1 if barr1 is lesser, 1 if barr1 is greater, and 0 if equal\n+ def bytearr_cmp(barr1, barr2):\n+    pos = 0\n+    while (pos < len(barr1) and pos < len(barr2)):\n+        if (barr1[pos] < barr2[pos]):\n+            return -1;\n+        elif (barr1[pos] > barr2[pos]):\n+            return 1;\n+        pos = pos + 1\n+    #the shorter array will be ordered first\n+    if (len(barr1) < len(barr2)):\n+        return -1\n+    elif (len(barr1) > len(barr2)):\n+        return 1\n+    else:\n+        return 0</nowiki>\n+\n+N.B. These comparisons do not need to operate in constant time since they are not processing secret information.\n+\n+===Transaction Inputs===\n+\n+104\tTransaction inputs are defined by the hash of a previous transaction, the output index of of a UTXO from that previous transaction, the size of an unlocking script, the unlocking script, and a sequence number. [3] For sorting inputs, the hash of the previous transaction and the output index within that transaction are sufficient for sorting purposes; each transaction hash has an extremely high probability of being unique in the blockchain — this is enforced for coinbase transactions by BIP30 — and output indices within a transaction are unique. For the sake of efficiency, transaction hashes should be compared first before output indices, since output indices from different transactions are often equivalent, while all bytes of the transaction hash are effectively random variables.\n+\n+Hashes of previous transactions are considered for the purposes of this BIP in their little-endian, byte array format in order to match the traditional, human-readable string representation of the hashes. They must be sorted in accordance with the output of the bytearr_cmp() function above: the hash with the earliest lesser byte is ordered first, and shorter hashes are ordered before longer ones as a tie-breaker. In the event of two matching transaction hashes, output indices will be compared based on their integer value, with the smaller value ordered first. A further tie is extremely improbable for the aforementioned reasons.",
