      "body": "@luke-jr added copyright section. I think this still needs more work, and some parts like the recommended deployment methods need more discussion. We can merge it and leave it as a draft and I open another PR with further changes. Or keep changing this one, whatever is preferred.\n\n@reviewers I'm going to switch from block height (which apparently only a couple of persons ) to the block median time, which shares its main advantages height while not having its \"hard to calculate dates\" problem. But in addition to the minimum activation median time, I'm going to maintain the 95% versionbits miner upgrade confirmation for uncontroversial hardforks (because if it's truly uncontroversial and we're expecting 100% of the users to upgrade before the minimum time, I think we can safely expect that also 95% of the miners (who are also users) will upgrade at some point). \n\n@kanzure I defined both softforks and hardforks and left the term \"unintentional consensus fork\" for unintentional consensus forks regardless of them being softforks or hardforks. I hopefully solved the rest of nits.\n\n@gavinandresen \n\n> I strongly disagree with \"there will likely.\"\n\nFine, I will s/there will likely be 2 chains/there will be 2 chains/ and, at the same time, be more strict defining the conditions when a schism hardfork happens. I agree that the schism hardfork section needs more work though.\n\n> Jorge's response of \"if there is demand then people will stick with the minority\" is where I take issue\n\nI never claimed to be able to predict whether \"people\" would stick to some particular chain or not, I said that if people stick to a chain and there's demand for the block reward in that chain, there will likely be miners to mine, even if it's just to sell it right away. This has been proven with a myriad of altcoins (including some like Freicoin that people assured me \"no body would ever mine\"). If there's demand, offer will likely appear, this is not specific to this market.\n\n> We saw this with the \"Lets stick with 50 BTC\" people around the first bitcoin halving.\n\nThank you very much! I didn't remember this.\nThis is an excellent past example of a schism hardfork. If I remember correctly, the fork only lasted a few blocks that time. But from one observation, we cannot infer that all cases will last that long or even that they will have an end at all.\n\nEDIT: if anybody has any links to the inflatacoin schism hardfork, they're more than welcomed!\n",

No software\n+maintainer has special powers over consensus rules changes. There's\n+many good reasons (experimentation, lack of features, independent\n+development, diversity, etc) to fork the Bitcoin core software and it's good\n+that there's many alternative implementations of the protocol (forks\n+of Bitcoin core or written from scratch).\n+\n+But sometimes a bug in the reimplementaion of the consensus\n+validation rules can prevent alternative implementation users from\n+following the longest (most work) valid chain. This can result in\n+those users losing coins or being defrauded, making reimplementations\n+of the consensus validation rules very risky. Note that a natural\n+language specification of those rules doesn't help since the\n+consensus is not determined by such specification but by the software\n+that the majority of the network runs. That's why \"the implementation\n+is the specification\".\n+\n+But Bitcoin core contains many more things than just consensus\n+validation and it would be unreasonable for all alternative\n+implementations to depend on it. Bitcoin core should not be the\n+specification. That's why the consensus validation is being separated\n+into a libbitcoinconsensus library with a C API easily accessible from\n+any language. This makes alternative implementations much more secure\n+without burdening them with specific design choices made by Bitcoin\n+core. It is to be noted that sharing the same code for consensus\n+validation doesn't prevent alternative implementations from\n+independently changing their consensus rules: they can always fork\n+the libbitcoinconsensus project (once it is in a separate repository). \n+\n+Hopefully libbitcoinconsensus will remove this type of consensus fork\n+which - being accidental - obviously don't need a deployment plan.\n+\n+====11/12 March 2013 Chain Fork====\n+\n+There is a precedent of an accidental consensus fork at height 225430.

Most miners had been fast on\n+upgrading to 0.8 and they were also fast on downgrading to 0.7 as an\n+emergency when they were ask to by the developers community.\n+\n+Without entering in much detail[2], the issue was that BDB was being\n+abandoned in favor of levelDB, and - at the same time - the miner's\n+policy block size limit was being lift (it was not a consensus rule,\n+not even enforced via softfork). Even after testing, a case where\n+levelDB couldn't correctly validate certain bigger blocks only appeared after\n+deployment in production. Fortunately this was handled very well and\n+rapidly by the whole worldwide community and nobody is unhappy about\n+the solution.\n+\n+But there's some philosophical disagreements on the terms of what the\n+solution was: we can add a pedantic note on that.   \n+If \"the implementation is the specification\", then those\n+levelDB-specific limitations were part of the consensus rules.\n+Then additional rules were necessary and any alternative\n+implementation (including 0.8) would have to implement it. Then a\n+planned consensus fork to migrate all Bitcoin-qt 0.7- users could\n+remove those additional consensus restrictions.\n+Had libconsensus being implemented without depending on levelDB,\n+those additional restrictions wouldn't have been \"the implementation\n+is the specification\" and this would just have been a bug in the\n+consensus rules, just a consensus-critical bug in a set of\n+implementations, concretely all satoshi-bitcoin-0.7-or-less (which\n+happened to be a huge super majority of the users), but other\n+implementations (like libbitcoin) would be free from such bug and\n+implementing the correct libconsensus specification. But since the\n+buggy implementation was a super-majority, the solution would have\n+been to instantly (from a specific block) change the rules to not let\n+the super-majority deviate from the specification and then have\n+another consensus fork to remove them. Two theoretical consensus forks\n+instead of one but the first one deployed practically for free. The\n+practical result would have been identical and only the definitions\n+change. This means discussing something that went uncontroversially\n+well further is \"philosophical bike-shed\" (TM).  \n+\n+===Unilateral softforks===\n+\n+If it is in their best interest of miners to softfork it should be\n+assumed that they may likely enforce it. In some cases, even against the will of a\n+super-majority of users. This is practically an attack on the network\n+and the only solution is to carefully design the incentives so that\n+the case is simply impossible. If that fails, miners should still\n+consider the risk of motivating a schism hardfork before attempting\n+such a consensus fork. A deployment plan for this case is also\n+unnecessary.\n+\n+===Schism[1] hardforks===\n+\n+In all of the following examples there's clearly a confrontation that\n+is being resolved using an intentional consensus fork.\n+\n+Being a schism hardfork, there will likely be 2 chains\n+coexisting for at least some time, maybe forever. Maybe bitcoin\n+becomes bitcoinA and bitcoinB. The implications for market\n+capitalization are completely unpredictable, \n+maybe mc(bitcoinA) = mc(bitcoinB) = mc(old_bitcoin), \n+maybe mc(bitcoinA) + mc(bitcoinB) = mc(old_bitcoin), \n+maybe mc(bitcoinA) + mc(bitcoinB) = 1000 * mc(old_bitcoin),\n+maybe mc(bitcoinA) + mc(bitcoinB) = 0,\n+... \n+\n+This is very disruptive and hopefully will never be needed. But if\n+it's needed the best deployment path is just to activate the rule\n+changes after certain block height in the future. On the other hand,\n+it is healthy decentralization-wise that many independent software\n+projects are ready to deploy a schism hardfork.\n+\n+====ASIC-reset hardfork====\n+\n+Imagine ASIC production has been consolidated to a single company and\n+distribution is simply not happening: the company is keeping them to\n+mine itself. For that or another reason, a single entity controls\n+40%+ of the hashrate and there's no hope for an spontaneous\n+improvement in decentralization. Such an untenable centralization could\n+be fixed (with great risks) by switching the hash function used in the\n+proof of work, effectively \"pressing the restart button\" on the ASIC\n+market. [The next function should be simple to implement in ASIC as\n+well so that the market can more easily develop as a healthy and\n+competitive one (as opposed to what the \"ASIC-hard\" proponents would\n+want), but that's another story...]\n+\n+Since in this case the confrontation is clearly against the current\n+miners any notion of \"miners' voting\" is utterly irrelevant.\n+\n+====Anti-Block-creator hardfork====\n+\n+There's less extreme cases where changing the pow function would not\n+be necessary. For example, let's imagine a bright future where\n+commoditized ASICs are running in millions home-heaters all over the\n+world, but the block size has been completely removed and the network has devolved to a\n+very centralized system where only 2 big pools have the resources to\n+fully validate full blocks and create block templates with competitive levels of\n+transaction fees. In that case, changing the pow function would be a\n+terrible waste and a risk that could be avoided. A hardfork restoring\n+a block size limit could help fixing this situation. Please don't\n+take it as an argument for or against raising the block size limit:\n+it's just an example. But in this case, again, those 2 big pools\n+would probably be against the fork and, again, their voting is\n+irrelevant.\n+\n+Like in the previous example, miners are expected to oppose and they\n+have to be ignored.\n+\n+====Anti-cabal hardfork====\n+\n+Let's imagine BIP66 [TODO remove has been deployed, but it] had a crypto backdoor\n+that nobody noticed and allows an evil developer cabal to steal\n+everyone's coins. The users and non-evil developers could join, fork\n+libconsensus and use the forked version in their respective bitcoin\n+implementations. \n+Should miner's \"vote\" to express their consent? What if some miners\n+are part of the cabal? In the unlikely event that most miners are\n+part of such an evil cabal, changing the pow function may be\n+required. In other cases, mining \"vote\" doesn't have much value\n+either since this kind of hardfork would not qualify as\n+uncontroversial anyway.\n+\n+===Uncontroversial consensus upgrades===\n+\n+\"Uncontroversial\" is something though to define in this context. What\n+if a single user decides he won't upgrade no matter what and\n+he doesn't even attempt to explain his decision? Obviously, such\n+a user should be just ignored. But what if the circumstances are\n+slightly different? What if they're 2, 10 users? where's the line.\n+It is possible that we can never have a better definition than \"I know\n+it when I see it\" [citation needed].\n+\n+====Uncontroversial softforks====\n+\n+If a majority of miners adopts a softfork, users will follow that\n+chain, even without understanding the new rules. For them is like\n+if blocks are created in a certain way or certain valid transactions\n+are being rejected by miners for some reason. For old nodes it just\n+looks like the new rules are policy rules rather than consensus rules.\n+This greatly reduces the deployment risks, making softforks the\n+preferred consensus rules upgrade mechanism.\n+\n+The first precedent of a softfork was the introduction of P2SH\n+documented in BIP16. There were competing proposals, but BIP12 had\n+clear disadvantage and  BIP17 was considered a less tested but\n+functionally equivalent version by most of the reviewers. Although it\n+was later discovered that BIP16 had unnecessary limitations and BIP17\n+is now considered superior, this probably still qualified for our\n+vague concept of \"uncontroversial\".\n+\n+At the time, there was no \"mining voting\" implementation and it was\n+simply deployed using the timestamp of the blocks at some time in the\n+future as the activation trigger. This can't guarantee the assumption\n+that most miners have upgraded before enforcing the new rules and\n+that's why the voting mechanism and first used for BIP30 and BIP66.\n+The current voting threshold for softfork enforcement is 95%. There's\n+also a 75% threshold for miners to activate it as a policy rule, but\n+it should be safe for miners to activate such a policy from the start\n+or later than 75%, as long as they enforce it as consensus rule after 95%. \n+\n+The current miners' voting mechanism can be modified to allow for\n+changes to be deployed in parallel, the rejection of a concrete\n+softfork without getting locked for the deployment of the next one,\n+and also a more efficient use of the version field in block\n+headers [3]. BIP65 is expected to be deployed with the improved\n+mechanism.\n+\n+====Uncontroversial hardforks====\n+\n+Some consensus changes require all participants to upgrade their software\n+before the new rules can be safely activated or they will face serious\n+risk of following the wrong chain and being defrauded. Even if the\n+exact same mechanism used for softforks would be more risky in these\n+cases, that doesn't mean that this type of changes cannot be deployed\n+in an uncontroversial and safe manner.\n+\n+The simplest approach is to select a block height far enough in the\n+future that everybody has plenty of time to change their software.\n+But if you're aiming for universal adoption, that includes miners'\n+adoption, so it seems reasonable to use a mining voting on top of\n+that. In this case there's only one relevant threshold and it could\n+be different from the softfork one. Probably 100% is too strict,\n+since it would allow a relatively small miner to attack the network\n+and block a consensus upgrade. Something between 99% and 95% is\n+probably a sensible choice for this parameter.\n+\n+====Uncontroversial emergency hardforks====\n+\n+Emergency forks may not have time to consult miners and have to be\n+deployed simply by choosing a block height not so far in the future.\n+\n+But emergency forks could be prepared ahead of time. For example, an\n+intermediary version of software could allow blocks\n+that are double the size of old blocks (after a certain height in the\n+future) while still making miners reject bigger blocks as a softfork\n+rule. Then miners can start the regular process for uncontroversial\n+softfork (or a unilateral softfork if they're a majority) at any\n+point in the future if it is required, and both intermediary and new\n+versions would be prepared for it (which would make deployment much\n+easier). Other related consensus changes could be deployed in the\n+meantime (say, quadrupling the block size) making the emergency\n+softfork unnecessary.\n+\n+==Code==\n+\n+This BIP is complemented with a concrete code proposal[4] for an\n+uncontroversial hardfork which acts as a precedent and removes the\n+perception that hardforks are impossible in Bitcoin. The deployment of\n+the proposal should not block any other potential hardforks (thus it\n+will required the version bits proposal[3] to be implemented). The\n+change itself doesn't add much complexity to Bitcoin Core and is simple\n+enough that is trivial to apply to diverse implementations (that\n+currently can only use libbitcoinconsensus to validate script-related\n+rules). The change has been already widely tested in many altcoins.\n+\n+The chosen consensus change is the fix of the timewarp attack\n+discovered and also fixed with a simple patch[5] by @ArtForz. This",

This can result in\n+those users losing coins or being defrauded, making reimplementations\n+of the consensus validation rules very risky. Note that a natural\n+language specification of those rules doesn't help since the\n+consensus is not determined by such specification but by the software\n+that the majority of the network runs. That's why \"the implementation\n+is the specification\".\n+\n+But Bitcoin core contains many more things than just consensus\n+validation and it would be unreasonable for all alternative\n+implementations to depend on it. Bitcoin core should not be the\n+specification. That's why the consensus validation is being separated\n+into a libbitcoinconsensus library with a C API easily accessible from\n+any language. This makes alternative implementations much more secure\n+without burdening them with specific design choices made by Bitcoin\n+core. It is to be noted that sharing the same code for consensus\n+validation doesn't prevent alternative implementations from\n+independently changing their consensus rules: they can always fork\n+the libbitcoinconsensus project (once it is in a separate repository). \n+\n+Hopefully libbitcoinconsensus will remove this type of consensus fork\n+which - being accidental - obviously don't need a deployment plan.\n+\n+====11/12 March 2013 Chain Fork====\n+\n+There is a precedent of an accidental consensus fork at height 225430. \n+Without entering in much detail, the situation was different from\n+what's being described from the alternative implementation risks (today alternative implementation\n+still usually rely in different degrees on bitcoin core trusted proxies, which\n+is very reasonable considering the lack of a complete\n+libbitcoinsensus).\n+The two conflicting consensus validation implementations were two\n+different versions of Bitcoin core (Bitcoin-qt at the time): 0.8\n+against all versions prior to it. Most miners had been fast on\n+upgrading to 0.8 and they were also fast on downgrading to 0.7 as an\n+emergency when they were ask to by the developers community.\n+\n+Without entering in much detail[2], the issue was that BDB was being\n+abandoned in favor of levelDB, and - at the same time - the miner's\n+policy block size limit was being lift (it was not a consensus rule,\n+not even enforced via softfork). Even after testing, a case where\n+levelDB couldn't correctly validate certain bigger blocks only appeared after\n+deployment in production. Fortunately this was handled very well and\n+rapidly by the whole worldwide community and nobody is unhappy about\n+the solution.\n+\n+But there's some philosophical disagreements on the terms of what the\n+solution was: we can add a pedantic note on that.   \n+If \"the implementation is the specification\", then those\n+levelDB-specific limitations were part of the consensus rules.\n+Then additional rules were necessary and any alternative\n+implementation (including 0.8) would have to implement it. Then a\n+planned consensus fork to migrate all Bitcoin-qt 0.7- users could\n+remove those additional consensus restrictions.\n+Had libconsensus being implemented without depending on levelDB,\n+those additional restrictions wouldn't have been \"the implementation\n+is the specification\" and this would just have been a bug in the\n+consensus rules, just a consensus-critical bug in a set of\n+implementations, concretely all satoshi-bitcoin-0.7-or-less (which\n+happened to be a huge super majority of the users), but other\n+implementations (like libbitcoin) would be free from such bug and\n+implementing the correct libconsensus specification. But since the\n+buggy implementation was a super-majority, the solution would have\n+been to instantly (from a specific block) change the rules to not let\n+the super-majority deviate from the specification and then have\n+another consensus fork to remove them. Two theoretical consensus forks\n+instead of one but the first one deployed practically for free. The\n+practical result would have been identical and only the definitions\n+change. This means discussing something that went uncontroversially\n+well further is \"philosophical bike-shed\" (TM).  \n+\n+===Unilateral softforks===\n+\n+If it is in their best interest of miners to softfork it should be\n+assumed that they may likely enforce it. In some cases, even against the will of a\n+super-majority of users. This is practically an attack on the network\n+and the only solution is to carefully design the incentives so that\n+the case is simply impossible. If that fails, miners should still\n+consider the risk of motivating a schism hardfork before attempting\n+such a consensus fork. A deployment plan for this case is also\n+unnecessary.\n+\n+===Schism[1] hardforks===\n+\n+In all of the following examples there's clearly a confrontation that\n+is being resolved using an intentional consensus fork.\n+\n+Being a schism hardfork, there will likely be 2 chains\n+coexisting for at least some time, maybe forever. Maybe bitcoin\n+becomes bitcoinA and bitcoinB. The implications for market\n+capitalization are completely unpredictable, \n+maybe mc(bitcoinA) = mc(bitcoinB) = mc(old_bitcoin), \n+maybe mc(bitcoinA) + mc(bitcoinB) = mc(old_bitcoin), \n+maybe mc(bitcoinA) + mc(bitcoinB) = 1000 * mc(old_bitcoin),\n+maybe mc(bitcoinA) + mc(bitcoinB) = 0,\n+... \n+\n+This is very disruptive and hopefully will never be needed. But if\n+it's needed the best deployment path is just to activate the rule\n+changes after certain block height in the future. On the other hand,\n+it is healthy decentralization-wise that many independent software\n+projects are ready to deploy a schism hardfork.\n+\n+====ASIC-reset hardfork====\n+\n+Imagine ASIC production has been consolidated to a single company and\n+distribution is simply not happening: the company is keeping them to\n+mine itself. For that or another reason, a single entity controls\n+40%+ of the hashrate and there's no hope for an spontaneous\n+improvement in decentralization. Such an untenable centralization could\n+be fixed (with great risks) by switching the hash function used in the\n+proof of work, effectively \"pressing the restart button\" on the ASIC\n+market. [The next function should be simple to implement in ASIC as\n+well so that the market can more easily develop as a healthy and\n+competitive one (as opposed to what the \"ASIC-hard\" proponents would\n+want), but that's another story...]\n+\n+Since in this case the confrontation is clearly against the current\n+miners any notion of \"miners' voting\" is utterly irrelevant.\n+\n+====Anti-Block-creator hardfork====\n+\n+There's less extreme cases where changing the pow function would not\n+be necessary. For example, let's imagine a bright future where\n+commoditized ASICs are running in millions home-heaters all over the\n+world, but the block size has been completely removed and the network has devolved to a\n+very centralized system where only 2 big pools have the resources to\n+fully validate full blocks and create block templates with competitive levels of\n+transaction fees. In that case, changing the pow function would be a\n+terrible waste and a risk that could be avoided. A hardfork restoring\n+a block size limit could help fixing this situation. Please don't\n+take it as an argument for or against raising the block size limit:\n+it's just an example. But in this case, again, those 2 big pools\n+would probably be against the fork and, again, their voting is\n+irrelevant.\n+\n+Like in the previous example, miners are expected to oppose and they\n+have to be ignored.\n+\n+====Anti-cabal hardfork====\n+\n+Let's imagine BIP66 [TODO remove has been deployed, but it] had a crypto backdoor\n+that nobody noticed and allows an evil developer cabal to steal\n+everyone's coins. The users and non-evil developers could join, fork\n+libconsensus and use the forked version in their respective bitcoin\n+implementations. \n+Should miner's \"vote\" to express their consent? What if some miners\n+are part of the cabal? In the unlikely event that most miners are\n+part of such an evil cabal, changing the pow function may be\n+required. In other cases, mining \"vote\" doesn't have much value\n+either since this kind of hardfork would not qualify as\n+uncontroversial anyway.\n+\n+===Uncontroversial consensus upgrades===\n+\n+\"Uncontroversial\" is something though to define in this context. What\n+if a single user decides he won't upgrade no matter what and\n+he doesn't even attempt to explain his decision? Obviously, such\n+a user should be just ignored. But what if the circumstances are\n+slightly different? What if they're 2, 10 users? where's the line.\n+It is possible that we can never have a better definition than \"I know\n+it when I see it\" [citation needed].\n+\n+====Uncontroversial softforks====\n+\n+If a majority of miners adopts a softfork, users will follow that\n+chain, even without understanding the new rules. For them is like\n+if blocks are created in a certain way or certain valid transactions\n+are being rejected by miners for some reason. For old nodes it just\n+looks like the new rules are policy rules rather than consensus rules.\n+This greatly reduces the deployment risks, making softforks the\n+preferred consensus rules upgrade mechanism.\n+\n+The first precedent of a softfork was the introduction of P2SH\n+documented in BIP16. There were competing proposals, but BIP12 had\n+clear disadvantage and  BIP17 was considered a less tested but\n+functionally equivalent version by most of the reviewers. Although it\n+was later discovered that BIP16 had unnecessary limitations and BIP17\n+is now considered superior, this probably still qualified for our\n+vague concept of \"uncontroversial\".\n+\n+At the time, there was no \"mining voting\" implementation and it was\n+simply deployed using the timestamp of the blocks at some time in the\n+future as the activation trigger. This can't guarantee the assumption\n+that most miners have upgraded before enforcing the new rules and\n+that's why the voting mechanism and first used for BIP30 and BIP66.\n+The current voting threshold for softfork enforcement is 95%. There's\n+also a 75% threshold for miners to activate it as a policy rule, but\n+it should be safe for miners to activate such a policy from the start\n+or later than 75%, as long as they enforce it as consensus rule after 95%. \n+\n+The current miners' voting mechanism can be modified to allow for\n+changes to be deployed in parallel, the rejection of a concrete\n+softfork without getting locked for the deployment of the next one,\n+and also a more efficient use of the version field in block\n+headers [3]. BIP65 is expected to be deployed with the improved\n+mechanism.\n+\n+====Uncontroversial hardforks====\n+\n+Some consensus changes require all participants to upgrade their software\n+before the new rules can be safely activated or they will face serious\n+risk of following the wrong chain and being defrauded. Even if the\n+exact same mechanism used for softforks would be more risky in these\n+cases, that doesn't mean that this type of changes cannot be deployed\n+in an uncontroversial and safe manner.\n+\n+The simplest approach is to select a block height far enough in the\n+future that everybody has plenty of time to change their software.\n+But if you're aiming for universal adoption, that includes miners'\n+adoption, so it seems reasonable to use a mining voting on top of\n+that. In this case there's only one relevant threshold and it could\n+be different from the softfork one. Probably 100% is too strict,\n+since it would allow a relatively small miner to attack the network\n+and block a consensus upgrade. Something between 99% and 95% is\n+probably a sensible choice for this parameter.\n+\n+====Uncontroversial emergency hardforks====\n+\n+Emergency forks may not have time to consult miners and have to be\n+deployed simply by choosing a block height not so far in the future.\n+\n+But emergency forks could be prepared ahead of time. For example, an\n+intermediary version of software could allow blocks\n+that are double the size of old blocks (after a certain height in the\n+future) while still making miners reject bigger blocks as a softfork\n+rule. Then miners can start the regular process for uncontroversial\n+softfork (or a unilateral softfork if they're a majority) at any\n+point in the future if it is required, and both intermediary and new\n+versions would be prepared for it (which would make deployment much\n+easier). Other related consensus changes could be deployed in the\n+meantime (say, quadrupling the block size) making the emergency\n+softfork unnecessary.\n+\n+==Code==\n+\n+This BIP is complemented with a concrete code proposal[4] for an\n+uncontroversial hardfork which acts as a precedent and removes the\n+perception that hardforks are impossible in Bitcoin. The deployment of\n+the proposal should not block any other potential hardforks (thus it\n+will required the version bits proposal[3] to be implemented). The\n+change itself doesn't add much complexity to Bitcoin Core and is simple\n+enough that is trivial to apply to diverse implementations (that\n+currently can only use libbitcoinconsensus to validate script-related\n+rules). The change has been already widely tested in many altcoins.\n+\n+The chosen consensus change is the fix of the timewarp attack\n+discovered and also fixed with a simple patch[5] by @ArtForz. This\n+change has been deployed by most altcoins that made any minimally\n+meaningful change to bitcoin and thus can be considered somewhat\n+tested (in fact, most SHA256d altcoins that didn't implemented it have",

What\n+if a single user decides he won't upgrade no matter what and\n+he doesn't even attempt to explain his decision? Obviously, such\n+a user should be just ignored. But what if the circumstances are\n+slightly different? What if they're 2, 10 users? where's the line.\n+It is possible that we can never have a better definition than \"I know\n+it when I see it\" [citation needed].\n+\n+====Uncontroversial softforks====\n+\n+If a majority of miners adopts a softfork, users will follow that\n+chain, even without understanding the new rules. For them is like\n+if blocks are created in a certain way or certain valid transactions\n+are being rejected by miners for some reason. For old nodes it just\n+looks like the new rules are policy rules rather than consensus rules.\n+This greatly reduces the deployment risks, making softforks the\n+preferred consensus rules upgrade mechanism.\n+\n+The first precedent of a softfork was the introduction of P2SH\n+documented in BIP16. There were competing proposals, but BIP12 had\n+clear disadvantage and  BIP17 was considered a less tested but\n+functionally equivalent version by most of the reviewers. Although it\n+was later discovered that BIP16 had unnecessary limitations and BIP17\n+is now considered superior, this probably still qualified for our\n+vague concept of \"uncontroversial\".\n+\n+At the time, there was no \"mining voting\" implementation and it was\n+simply deployed using the timestamp of the blocks at some time in the\n+future as the activation trigger. This can't guarantee the assumption\n+that most miners have upgraded before enforcing the new rules and\n+that's why the voting mechanism and first used for BIP30 and BIP66.\n+The current voting threshold for softfork enforcement is 95%. There's\n+also a 75% threshold for miners to activate it as a policy rule, but\n+it should be safe for miners to activate such a policy from the start\n+or later than 75%, as long as they enforce it as consensus rule after 95%. \n+\n+The current miners' voting mechanism can be modified to allow for\n+changes to be deployed in parallel, the rejection of a concrete\n+softfork without getting locked for the deployment of the next one,\n+and also a more efficient use of the version field in block\n+headers [3]. BIP65 is expected to be deployed with the improved\n+mechanism.\n+\n+====Uncontroversial hardforks====\n+\n+Some consensus changes require all participants to upgrade their software\n+before the new rules can be safely activated or they will face serious\n+risk of following the wrong chain and being defrauded. Even if the\n+exact same mechanism used for softforks would be more risky in these\n+cases, that doesn't mean that this type of changes cannot be deployed\n+in an uncontroversial and safe manner.\n+\n+The simplest approach is to select a block height far enough in the\n+future that everybody has plenty of time to change their software.\n+But if you're aiming for universal adoption, that includes miners'\n+adoption, so it seems reasonable to use a mining voting on top of\n+that. In this case there's only one relevant threshold and it could\n+be different from the softfork one. Probably 100% is too strict,\n+since it would allow a relatively small miner to attack the network\n+and block a consensus upgrade. Something between 99% and 95% is\n+probably a sensible choice for this parameter.\n+\n+====Uncontroversial emergency hardforks====\n+\n+Emergency forks may not have time to consult miners and have to be\n+deployed simply by choosing a block height not so far in the future.\n+\n+But emergency forks could be prepared ahead of time. For example, an\n+intermediary version of software could allow blocks\n+that are double the size of old blocks (after a certain height in the\n+future) while still making miners reject bigger blocks as a softfork\n+rule. Then miners can start the regular process for uncontroversial\n+softfork (or a unilateral softfork if they're a majority) at any\n+point in the future if it is required, and both intermediary and new\n+versions would be prepared for it (which would make deployment much\n+easier). Other related consensus changes could be deployed in the\n+meantime (say, quadrupling the block size) making the emergency\n+softfork unnecessary.\n+\n+==Code==\n+\n+This BIP is complemented with a concrete code proposal[4] for an\n+uncontroversial hardfork which acts as a precedent and removes the\n+perception that hardforks are impossible in Bitcoin. The deployment of\n+the proposal should not block any other potential hardforks (thus it\n+will required the version bits proposal[3] to be implemented). The\n+change itself doesn't add much complexity to Bitcoin Core and is simple\n+enough that is trivial to apply to diverse implementations (that\n+currently can only use libbitcoinconsensus to validate script-related\n+rules). The change has been already widely tested in many altcoins.\n+\n+The chosen consensus change is the fix of the timewarp attack\n+discovered and also fixed with a simple patch[5] by @ArtForz. This\n+change has been deployed by most altcoins that made any minimally\n+meaningful change to bitcoin and thus can be considered somewhat\n+tested (in fact, most SHA256d altcoins that didn't implemented it have\n+died or being forced to implement it as an emergency hardfork). When\n+deploying this change has been discussed, usually arguments in the\n+lines of \"if we get to the point when this matters to bitcoin, we\n+would be already in serious trouble\" were used against it. This\n+shouldn't be seen as a disadvantage in this context, since it means we\n+can safely activate the fix very far away in the future (say, 4 years\n+worth of blocks).\n+\n+==Attribution==\n+\n+Incorporated suggestions from @btcdrak.\n+\n+==Footnotes==\n+\n+[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schism\n+\n+[2] https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0050.mediawiki\n+\n+[3] http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/34146741/ ",

This can be intentional or be caused by a\n+  bug in consensus validation reimplementations.\n+- Softfork: an intentional consensus fork where everything that\n+  was previously invalid remains invalid, but some things that were\n+  valid also become invalid. Majority of miners can impose\n+  this kind of changes and they also have some deployment advantages.\n+- Hardfork: an intentional consensus fork that is not a softfork.\n+\n+==Taxonomy of consensus forks==\n+\n+===Accidental consensus fork===\n+\n+Software forks are very different in nature from consensus rules forks. No software\n+maintainer has special powers over consensus rules changes. There's\n+many good reasons (experimentation, lack of features, independent\n+development, diversity, etc) to fork the Bitcoin core software and it's good\n+that there's many alternative implementations of the protocol (forks\n+of Bitcoin core or written from scratch).\n+\n+But sometimes a bug in the reimplementaion of the consensus\n+validation rules can prevent alternative implementation users from\n+following the longest (most work) valid chain. This can result in\n+those users losing coins or being defrauded, making reimplementations\n+of the consensus validation rules very risky. Note that a natural\n+language specification of those rules doesn't help since the\n+consensus is not determined by such specification but by the software\n+that the majority of the network runs. That's why \"the implementation\n+is the specification\".\n+\n+But Bitcoin core contains many more things than just consensus\n+validation and it would be unreasonable for all alternative\n+implementations to depend on it. Bitcoin core should not be the\n+specification. That's why the consensus validation is being separated\n+into a libbitcoinconsensus library with a C API easily accessible from\n+any language. This makes alternative implementations much more secure\n+without burdening them with specific design choices made by Bitcoin\n+core. It is to be noted that sharing the same code for consensus\n+validation doesn't prevent alternative implementations from\n+independently changing their consensus rules: they can always fork\n+the libbitcoinconsensus project (once it is in a separate repository). \n+\n+Hopefully libbitcoinconsensus will remove this type of consensus fork\n+which - being accidental - obviously don't need a deployment plan.\n+\n+====11/12 March 2013 Chain Fork====\n+\n+There is a precedent of an accidental consensus fork at height 225430. \n+Without entering in much detail, the situation was different from\n+what's being described from the alternative implementation risks (today alternative implementation\n+still usually rely in different degrees on bitcoin core trusted proxies, which\n+is very reasonable considering the lack of a complete\n+libbitcoinsensus).\n+The two conflicting consensus validation implementations were two\n+different versions of Bitcoin core (Bitcoin-qt at the time): 0.8\n+against all versions prior to it. Most miners had been fast on\n+upgrading to 0.8 and they were also fast on downgrading to 0.7 as an\n+emergency when they were ask to by the developers community.\n+\n+Without entering in much detail[2], the issue was that BDB was being\n+abandoned in favor of levelDB, and - at the same time - the miner's\n+policy block size limit was being lift (it was not a consensus rule,\n+not even enforced via softfork). Even after testing, a case where\n+levelDB couldn't correctly validate certain bigger blocks only appeared after\n+deployment in production. Fortunately this was handled very well and\n+rapidly by the whole worldwide community and nobody is unhappy about\n+the solution.\n+\n+But there's some philosophical disagreements on the terms of what the\n+solution was: we can add a pedantic note on that.   \n+If \"the implementation is the specification\", then those\n+levelDB-specific limitations were part of the consensus rules.\n+Then additional rules were necessary and any alternative\n+implementation (including 0.8) would have to implement it. Then a\n+planned consensus fork to migrate all Bitcoin-qt 0.7- users could\n+remove those additional consensus restrictions.\n+Had libconsensus being implemented without depending on levelDB,\n+those additional restrictions wouldn't have been \"the implementation\n+is the specification\" and this would just have been a bug in the\n+consensus rules, just a consensus-critical bug in a set of\n+implementations, concretely all satoshi-bitcoin-0.7-or-less (which\n+happened to be a huge super majority of the users), but other\n+implementations (like libbitcoin) would be free from such bug and\n+implementing the correct libconsensus specification. But since the\n+buggy implementation was a super-majority, the solution would have\n+been to instantly (from a specific block) change the rules to not let\n+the super-majority deviate from the specification and then have\n+another consensus fork to remove them. Two theoretical consensus forks\n+instead of one but the first one deployed practically for free. The\n+practical result would have been identical and only the definitions\n+change. This means discussing something that went uncontroversially\n+well further is \"philosophical bike-shed\" (TM).  \n+\n+===Unilateral softforks===\n+\n+If it is in their best interest of miners to softfork it should be\n+assumed that they may likely enforce it. In some cases, even against the will of a\n+super-majority of users. This is practically an attack on the network\n+and the only solution is to carefully design the incentives so that\n+the case is simply impossible. If that fails, miners should still\n+consider the risk of motivating a schism hardfork before attempting\n+such a consensus fork. A deployment plan for this case is also\n+unnecessary.\n+\n+===Schism[1] hardforks===\n+\n+In all of the following examples there's clearly a confrontation that\n+is being resolved using an intentional consensus fork.\n+\n+Being a schism hardfork, there will likely be 2 chains\n+coexisting for at least some time, maybe forever. Maybe bitcoin\n+becomes bitcoinA and bitcoinB. The implications for market\n+capitalization are completely unpredictable, \n+maybe mc(bitcoinA) = mc(bitcoinB) = mc(old_bitcoin), \n+maybe mc(bitcoinA) + mc(bitcoinB) = mc(old_bitcoin), \n+maybe mc(bitcoinA) + mc(bitcoinB) = 1000 * mc(old_bitcoin),\n+maybe mc(bitcoinA) + mc(bitcoinB) = 0,\n+... \n+\n+This is very disruptive and hopefully will never be needed. But if\n+it's needed the best deployment path is just to activate the rule\n+changes after certain block height in the future. On the other hand,\n+it is healthy decentralization-wise that many independent software\n+projects are ready to deploy a schism hardfork.\n+\n+====ASIC-reset hardfork====\n+\n+Imagine ASIC production has been consolidated to a single company and\n+distribution is simply not happening: the company is keeping them to\n+mine itself. For that or another reason, a single entity controls\n+40%+ of the hashrate and there's no hope for an spontaneous\n+improvement in decentralization. Such an untenable centralization could\n+be fixed (with great risks) by switching the hash function used in the\n+proof of work, effectively \"pressing the restart button\" on the ASIC\n+market. [The next function should be simple to implement in ASIC as\n+well so that the market can more easily develop as a healthy and\n+competitive one (as opposed to what the \"ASIC-hard\" proponents would\n+want), but that's another story...]\n+\n+Since in this case the confrontation is clearly against the current\n+miners any notion of \"miners' voting\" is utterly irrelevant.\n+\n+====Anti-Block-creator hardfork====\n+\n+There's less extreme cases where changing the pow function would not\n+be necessary. For example, let's imagine a bright future where\n+commoditized ASICs are running in millions home-heaters all over the\n+world, but the block size has been completely removed and the network has devolved to a\n+very centralized system where only 2 big pools have the resources to\n+fully validate full blocks and create block templates with competitive levels of\n+transaction fees. In that case, changing the pow function would be a\n+terrible waste and a risk that could be avoided. A hardfork restoring\n+a block size limit could help fixing this situation. Please don't\n+take it as an argument for or against raising the block size limit:\n+it's just an example. But in this case, again, those 2 big pools\n+would probably be against the fork and, again, their voting is\n+irrelevant.\n+\n+Like in the previous example, miners are expected to oppose and they\n+have to be ignored.\n+\n+====Anti-cabal hardfork====\n+\n+Let's imagine BIP66 [TODO remove has been deployed, but it] had a crypto backdoor\n+that nobody noticed and allows an evil developer cabal to steal\n+everyone's coins. The users and non-evil developers could join, fork\n+libconsensus and use the forked version in their respective bitcoin\n+implementations. \n+Should miner's \"vote\" to express their consent? What if some miners\n+are part of the cabal? In the unlikely event that most miners are\n+part of such an evil cabal, changing the pow function may be\n+required. In other cases, mining \"vote\" doesn't have much value\n+either since this kind of hardfork would not qualify as\n+uncontroversial anyway.\n+\n+===Uncontroversial consensus upgrades===\n+\n+\"Uncontroversial\" is something though to define in this context.

Most miners had been fast on\n+upgrading to 0.8 and they were also fast on downgrading to 0.7 as an\n+emergency when they were ask to by the developers community.\n+\n+Without entering in much detail[2], the issue was that BDB was being\n+abandoned in favor of levelDB, and - at the same time - the miner's\n+policy block size limit was being lift (it was not a consensus rule,\n+not even enforced via softfork). Even after testing, a case where\n+levelDB couldn't correctly validate certain bigger blocks only appeared after\n+deployment in production. Fortunately this was handled very well and\n+rapidly by the whole worldwide community and nobody is unhappy about\n+the solution.\n+\n+But there's some philosophical disagreements on the terms of what the\n+solution was: we can add a pedantic note on that.   \n+If \"the implementation is the specification\", then those\n+levelDB-specific limitations were part of the consensus rules.\n+Then additional rules were necessary and any alternative\n+implementation (including 0.8) would have to implement it. Then a\n+planned consensus fork to migrate all Bitcoin-qt 0.7- users could\n+remove those additional consensus restrictions.\n+Had libconsensus being implemented without depending on levelDB,\n+those additional restrictions wouldn't have been \"the implementation\n+is the specification\" and this would just have been a bug in the\n+consensus rules, just a consensus-critical bug in a set of\n+implementations, concretely all satoshi-bitcoin-0.7-or-less (which\n+happened to be a huge super majority of the users), but other\n+implementations (like libbitcoin) would be free from such bug and\n+implementing the correct libconsensus specification. But since the\n+buggy implementation was a super-majority, the solution would have\n+been to instantly (from a specific block) change the rules to not let\n+the super-majority deviate from the specification and then have\n+another consensus fork to remove them. Two theoretical consensus forks\n+instead of one but the first one deployed practically for free. The\n+practical result would have been identical and only the definitions\n+change. This means discussing something that went uncontroversially\n+well further is \"philosophical bike-shed\" (TM).  \n+\n+===Unilateral softforks===\n+\n+If it is in their best interest of miners to softfork it should be\n+assumed that they may likely enforce it. In some cases, even against the will of a\n+super-majority of users. This is practically an attack on the network\n+and the only solution is to carefully design the incentives so that\n+the case is simply impossible. If that fails, miners should still\n+consider the risk of motivating a schism hardfork before attempting\n+such a consensus fork. A deployment plan for this case is also\n+unnecessary.\n+\n+===Schism[1] hardforks===\n+\n+In all of the following examples there's clearly a confrontation that\n+is being resolved using an intentional consensus fork.\n+\n+Being a schism hardfork, there will likely be 2 chains\n+coexisting for at least some time, maybe forever.

This can be intentional or be caused by a\n+  bug in consensus validation reimplementations.\n+- Softfork: an intentional consensus fork where everything that\n+  was previously invalid remains invalid, but some things that were\n+  valid also become invalid. Majority of miners can impose\n+  this kind of changes and they also have some deployment advantages.\n+- Hardfork: an intentional consensus fork that is not a softfork.\n+\n+==Taxonomy of consensus forks==\n+\n+===Accidental consensus fork===\n+\n+Software forks are very different in nature from consensus rules forks. No software\n+maintainer has special powers over consensus rules changes. There's\n+many good reasons (experimentation, lack of features, independent\n+development, diversity, etc) to fork the Bitcoin core software and it's good\n+that there's many alternative implementations of the protocol (forks\n+of Bitcoin core or written from scratch).\n+\n+But sometimes a bug in the reimplementaion of the consensus\n+validation rules can prevent alternative implementation users from\n+following the longest (most work) valid chain. This can result in\n+those users losing coins or being defrauded, making reimplementations\n+of the consensus validation rules very risky. Note that a natural\n+language specification of those rules doesn't help since the\n+consensus is not determined by such specification but by the software\n+that the majority of the network runs. That's why \"the implementation\n+is the specification\".\n+\n+But Bitcoin core contains many more things than just consensus\n+validation and it would be unreasonable for all alternative\n+implementations to depend on it. Bitcoin core should not be the\n+specification. That's why the consensus validation is being separated\n+into a libbitcoinconsensus library with a C API easily accessible from\n+any language. This makes alternative implementations much more secure\n+without burdening them with specific design choices made by Bitcoin\n+core. It is to be noted that sharing the same code for consensus\n+validation doesn't prevent alternative implementations from\n+independently changing their consensus rules: they can always fork\n+the libbitcoinconsensus project (once it is in a separate repository). \n+\n+Hopefully libbitcoinconsensus will remove this type of consensus fork\n+which - being accidental - obviously don't need a deployment plan.\n+\n+====11/12 March 2013 Chain Fork====\n+\n+There is a precedent of an accidental consensus fork at height 225430. \n+Without entering in much detail, the situation was different from\n+what's being described from the alternative implementation risks (today alternative implementation\n+still usually rely in different degrees on bitcoin core trusted proxies, which\n+is very reasonable considering the lack of a complete\n+libbitcoinsensus).\n+The two conflicting consensus validation implementations were two\n+different versions of Bitcoin core (Bitcoin-qt at the time): 0.8\n+against all versions prior to it.

This is practically an attack on the network\n+and the only solution is to carefully design the incentives so that\n+the case is simply impossible. If that fails, miners should still\n+consider the risk of motivating a schism hardfork before attempting\n+such a consensus fork. A deployment plan for this case is also\n+unnecessary.\n+\n+===Schism[1] hardforks===\n+\n+In all of the following examples there's clearly a confrontation that\n+is being resolved using an intentional consensus fork.\n+\n+Being a schism hardfork, there will likely be 2 chains\n+coexisting for at least some time, maybe forever. Maybe bitcoin\n+becomes bitcoinA and bitcoinB. The implications for market\n+capitalization are completely unpredictable, \n+maybe mc(bitcoinA) = mc(bitcoinB) = mc(old_bitcoin), \n+maybe mc(bitcoinA) + mc(bitcoinB) = mc(old_bitcoin), \n+maybe mc(bitcoinA) + mc(bitcoinB) = 1000 * mc(old_bitcoin),\n+maybe mc(bitcoinA) + mc(bitcoinB) = 0,\n+... \n+\n+This is very disruptive and hopefully will never be needed. But if\n+it's needed the best deployment path is just to activate the rule\n+changes after certain block height in the future. On the other hand,\n+it is healthy decentralization-wise that many independent software\n+projects are ready to deploy a schism hardfork.\n+\n+====ASIC-reset hardfork====\n+\n+Imagine ASIC production has been consolidated to a single company and\n+distribution is simply not happening: the company is keeping them to\n+mine itself. For that or another reason, a single entity controls\n+40%+ of the hashrate and there's no hope for an spontaneous\n+improvement in decentralization. Such an untenable centralization could\n+be fixed (with great risks) by switching the hash function used in the\n+proof of work, effectively \"pressing the restart button\" on the ASIC\n+market. [The next function should be simple to implement in ASIC as\n+well so that the market can more easily develop as a healthy and\n+competitive one (as opposed to what the \"ASIC-hard\" proponents would\n+want), but that's another story...]\n+\n+Since in this case the confrontation is clearly against the current\n+miners any notion of \"miners' voting\" is utterly irrelevant.\n+\n+====Anti-Block-creator hardfork====\n+\n+There's less extreme cases where changing the pow function would not\n+be necessary. For example, let's imagine a bright future where\n+commoditized ASICs are running in millions home-heaters all over the\n+world, but the block size has been completely removed and the network has devolved to a\n+very centralized system where only 2 big pools have the resources to\n+fully validate full blocks and create block templates with competitive levels of\n+transaction fees. In that case, changing the pow function would be a\n+terrible waste and a risk that could be avoided. A hardfork restoring\n+a block size limit could help fixing this situation. Please don't\n+take it as an argument for or against raising the block size limit:\n+it's just an example. But in this case, again, those 2 big pools\n+would probably be against the fork and, again, their voting is\n+irrelevant.\n+\n+Like in the previous example, miners are expected to oppose and they\n+have to be ignored.\n+\n+====Anti-cabal hardfork====\n+\n+Let's imagine BIP66 [TODO remove has been deployed, but it] had a crypto backdoor\n+that nobody noticed and allows an evil developer cabal to steal\n+everyone's coins. The users and non-evil developers could join, fork\n+libconsensus and use the forked version in their respective bitcoin\n+implementations. \n+Should miner's \"vote\" to express their consent? What if some miners\n+are part of the cabal? In the unlikely event that most miners are\n+part of such an evil cabal, changing the pow function may be\n+required. In other cases, mining \"vote\" doesn't have much value\n+either since this kind of hardfork would not qualify as\n+uncontroversial anyway.\n+\n+===Uncontroversial consensus upgrades===\n+\n+\"Uncontroversial\" is something though to define in this context. What\n+if a single user decides he won't upgrade no matter what and\n+he doesn't even attempt to explain his decision? Obviously, such\n+a user should be just ignored. But what if the circumstances are\n+slightly different? What if they're 2, 10 users? where's the line.\n+It is possible that we can never have a better definition than \"I know\n+it when I see it\" [citation needed].\n+\n+====Uncontroversial softforks====\n+\n+If a majority of miners adopts a softfork, users will follow that\n+chain, even without understanding the new rules. For them is like\n+if blocks are created in a certain way or certain valid transactions\n+are being rejected by miners for some reason. For old nodes it just\n+looks like the new rules are policy rules rather than consensus rules.\n+This greatly reduces the deployment risks, making softforks the\n+preferred consensus rules upgrade mechanism.\n+\n+The first precedent of a softfork was the introduction of P2SH\n+documented in BIP16. There were competing proposals, but BIP12 had\n+clear disadvantage and  BIP17 was considered a less tested but\n+functionally equivalent version by most of the reviewers. Although it\n+was later discovered that BIP16 had unnecessary limitations and BIP17\n+is now considered superior, this probably still qualified for our\n+vague concept of \"uncontroversial\".\n+\n+At the time, there was no \"mining voting\" implementation and it was\n+simply deployed using the timestamp of the blocks at some time in the\n+future as the activation trigger. This can't guarantee the assumption\n+that most miners have upgraded before enforcing the new rules and\n+that's why the voting mechanism and first used for BIP30 and BIP66.\n+The current voting threshold for softfork enforcement is 95%. There's\n+also a 75% threshold for miners to activate it as a policy rule, but\n+it should be safe for miners to activate such a policy from the start\n+or later than 75%, as long as they enforce it as consensus rule after 95%. \n+\n+The current miners' voting mechanism can be modified to allow for\n+changes to be deployed in parallel, the rejection of a concrete\n+softfork without getting locked for the deployment of the next one,\n+and also a more efficient use of the version field in block\n+headers [3]. BIP65 is expected to be deployed with the improved\n+mechanism.\n+\n+====Uncontroversial hardforks====\n+\n+Some consensus changes require all participants to upgrade their software\n+before the new rules can be safely activated or they will face serious\n+risk of following the wrong chain and being defrauded. Even if the\n+exact same mechanism used for softforks would be more risky in these\n+cases, that doesn't mean that this type of changes cannot be deployed\n+in an uncontroversial and safe manner.\n+\n+The simplest approach is to select a block height far enough in the\n+future that everybody has plenty of time to change their software.\n+But if you're aiming for universal adoption, that includes miners'\n+adoption, so it seems reasonable to use a mining voting on top of\n+that. In this case there's only one relevant threshold and it could\n+be different from the softfork one. Probably 100% is too strict,\n+since it would allow a relatively small miner to attack the network\n+and block a consensus upgrade. Something between 99% and 95% is\n+probably a sensible choice for this parameter.\n+\n+====Uncontroversial emergency hardforks====\n+\n+Emergency forks may not have time to consult miners and have to be\n+deployed simply by choosing a block height not so far in the future.\n+\n+But emergency forks could be prepared ahead of time. For example, an\n+intermediary version of software could allow blocks\n+that are double the size of old blocks (after a certain height in the\n+future) while still making miners reject bigger blocks as a softfork\n+rule. Then miners can start the regular process for uncontroversial\n+softfork (or a unilateral softfork if they're a majority) at any\n+point in the future if it is required, and both intermediary and new\n+versions would be prepared for it (which would make deployment much\n+easier). Other related consensus changes could be deployed in the\n+meantime (say, quadrupling the block size) making the emergency\n+softfork unnecessary.\n+\n+==Code==\n+\n+This BIP is complemented with a concrete code proposal[4] for an\n+uncontroversial hardfork which acts as a precedent and removes the\n+perception that hardforks are impossible in Bitcoin. The deployment of\n+the proposal should not block any other potential hardforks (thus it\n+will required the version bits proposal[3] to be implemented). The\n+change itself doesn't add much complexity to Bitcoin Core and is simple\n+enough that is trivial to apply to diverse implementations (that\n+currently can only use libbitcoinconsensus to validate script-related\n+rules). The change has been already widely tested in many altcoins.\n+\n+The chosen consensus change is the fix of the timewarp attack\n+discovered and also fixed with a simple patch[5] by @ArtForz. This",
