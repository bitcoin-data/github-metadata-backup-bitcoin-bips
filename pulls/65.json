More context here http://blog.greenaddress.it/2014/04/18/when-you-can-and-cant-rely-on-0-confirmations/ and http://ghgreenaddress.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/greenaddressp2sh2of2hd-61.pdf\n\nThis is not intended to a be a private extension but to be reusable.\n",

      "body": "Let's discuss the best way to extend BIP70 on the mailing list.\n\nComments re: this design specifically. I know X.509 can seem complicated but there are good reasons to use it.\n\nFirstly, your current design assumes merchants have a way to manually fetch a key given the domain name of the wallet. Probably those merchants will just fetch a file on your webserver over HTTPS. So you already need a certificate and have it configured already.\n\nSecondly, your design is very simple. If this BIP became successful then someone would observe that lots of merchants have started trusting your key, but you have no way to notify them in case you need to change your key due to e.g. a server breach. So then you might be tempted to say \"a correct implementation will download the key via HTTPS each time\". But now there's a lot of traffic, so you'd need to amend it once again to tell people that they must respect cache headers. Some of them will forget. You're already replicating at least two features of certificates (expiry time and domain identity) but without the reusable libraries.\n\nNow someone observes that not all wallets are websites. Perhaps a hardware wallet like the TREZOR is upgraded to start tracking which outputs it signed for and refusing to do so again. It wants to take part in this protocol too, using a device-specific key that's embedded into the chips at the factory. But now it doesn't fit with your design because there's no way to do an HTTPS GET from a TREZOR. So you say maybe the manufacturer key could sign device keys in a chain, and then the signature contains the signed device key .... now you have a cert chain.\n\nIf this new hardware wallet gets put under a scanning electron microscope and the per-device key is extracted then used for fraud, it'd be nice if there was a way to revoke it without revoking all the devices at once. Now you have OCSP.\n\nRather than replicating all the features of certificates that evolved over years of improvement, it seems simpler to just reuse the existing libraries for it.\n",
