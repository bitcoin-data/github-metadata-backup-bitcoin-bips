      "body": "One thing to consider is behaviour when the parameters for a deployment are changed while it is in progress.\r\n\r\nThe \"miners attempt to discourage users from setting lockinontimeout=true\" scenario is one of those in a sense. In more detail: `timeoutheight - 2016` is reached, then a block that does not signal is mined, and a few hours worth of additional blocks are then mined on top of that. Miners say \"we don't want to throw away that work, so please just unset `lockinontimeout` and we'll promise to make sure it activates!\" Then the last 100 blocks are all mined with the bit unset, and users either have to do a 2016 block reorg by setting lockinontimeout back to true, or have to start a new deployment attempt and try again. Reducing the threshold for MUST_SIGNAL from 100% down to the same as that for STARTED allows the code to cope with a small mistake like a single block failing to signal automatically.\r\n\r\nAnother parameter change case worth considering, is reducing the timeoutheight. If a node has `timeoutheight = T, lockinontimeout=true` then any valid chain will result in activation at some height `A`, and any other node with the same `startheight` and `threshold` but with `timeoutheight > T` -- will see that chain as valid, and also consider activation to occur at height `A` -- either because there was sufficient signalling prior and both nodes transition through STARTED, LOCKED_IN to ACTIVE at the same points, or because the first node transition from STARTED to MUST_SIGNAL while the second node remained in STARTED, but both nodes transition to LOCKED_IN and then ACTIVE at the same times, since a valid chain that passes through MUST_SIGNAL will also pass the threshold for a node to transition from STARTED to LOCKED_IN.\r\n\r\nDecreasing the `threshold` parameter is not compatible, however. With BIP8 as it stands, if two nodes have the same `startheight`, `timeoutheight` but one node has a `threshold = X` and the other has `threshold = Y, Y > X`, then if there is a sequence of retarget periods that begin in STARTED, they will not be in consensus:\r\n\r\n* X blocks signal; all blocks signal; no blocks signal\r\n  + the first node will consider the statuses to be STARTED, LOCKED_IN, ACTIVE\r\n  + the second node will consider blocks to be STARTED, STARTED, invalid due to lack of signalling during LOCKED_IN\r\n* X blocks signal; Y blocks signal, all blocks signal\r\n  + the first node will consider the statuses to be STARTED, LOCKED_IN, invalid due to lack of signalling during LOCKED_IN\r\n  + the second node will consider blocks to be STARTED, STARTED, LOCKED_IN [then ACTIVE]\r\n\r\nWithout mandatory signalling during LOCKED_IN, the incompatibility changes -- activation for the first node by X blocks signalling does not affect the second node at all, so that the first node may consider the deployment to have activated while the second node does not, and this obviously becomes complicated if the second node has `lockinontimeout=true`. With MUST_SIGNAL requiring only threshold blocks to signal rather than all blocks, consensus divergence becomes possible in the final period as well.\r\n\r\nIn general if it is desirable to reduce the threshold for activation, I think taking the BIP-91 approach and instead introducing a new deployment with a reduced threshold that then triggers mandatory signalling of the original deployment at its original threshold seems a much safer approach.",
