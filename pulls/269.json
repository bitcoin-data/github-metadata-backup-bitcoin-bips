    "body": "The BIP1 text has been updated to clarify how early stage idea championing works.\n\nThe text itself is not significantly different, for the most part these changes involved reordering the existing sentences and paragraphs, and removing some conflicting ambiguous details. LIkewise, the previous reasons for BIP editor rejection of a (e.g. malformed) BIP have been consolidated into closer proximity in the text. I suspect that this will help readers understand the process better.\n\nAlso, this branch includes some trivial boring BIP1 changes like:\n- \"Bitcoin mailing list\" -> \"bitcoin-dev mailing list\"\n- \"Bitcoin repository\" -> \"relevant Bitcoin repository\" (originally I was going for \"Bitcoin Core\" but Luke-Jr mentioned a good NACK reason)\n- \"Bitcoin issue tracker\" -> \"relevant Bitcoin issue tracker\" (same reasoning)\n\nI originally brought up the issue (of BIP1 early-stage championing ambiguity) in the bitcoin-dev IRC channel on freenode a few hours ago:\nhttp://bitcoinstats.com/irc/bitcoin-dev/logs/2016/01/01#l1451664846.0\n\nOnly somewhat related, but I found this email interesting:\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-September/010955.html\n\nThis pull request text was written as of commit 66224130f03ffb94daae9692d1b8d25b1c35e6ba.\n",

Posting to the [https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev bitcoin-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org] mailing list (and maybe the [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0 Development & Technical Discussion] forum) is the best way to go about this.\n \n-Authors MUST NOT self assign numbers, but should use an alias such as \"bip-johndoe-infinitebitcoins\" which includes the author's name/nick and the BIP subject.\n+Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a BIP is meant to both save the potential author and the wider community time. Many ideas have been brought forward for changing Bitcoin that have been rejected for various reasons. Asking the Bitcoin community first if an idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching the internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in most areas where Bitcoin is used. Small enhancements or patches often don't need a BIP and can be injected into the Bitcoin Core development work flow with a patch submission to the Bitcoin Core issue tracker.\n \n-The BIP process begins with a new idea for Bitcoin. It is highly recommended that a single BIP contain a single key proposal or new idea. Small enhancements or patches often don't need a BIP and can be injected into the Bitcoin development work flow with a patch submission to the Bitcoin issue tracker. The more focused the BIP, the more successful it tends to be. The BIP editor reserves the right to reject BIP proposals if they appear too unfocused or too broad. If in doubt, split your BIP into several well-focused ones.\n+Once the champion has asked the Bitcoin community as to whether an idea has any chance of acceptance, a draft BIP should be presented to the [https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev bitcoin-dev] mailing list. This gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft BIP to make it properly formatted, of high quality, and to address additional concerns about the proposal. Following a discussion, the proposal should be sent to the bitcoin-dev list and the BIP editor with the draft BIP. This draft must be written in BIP style as described below, else it will be sent back without further regard until proper formatting rules are followed.\n \n-Each BIP must have a champion -- someone who writes the BIP using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea.

However, wherever possible, long open-ended discussions on public mailing lists should be avoided.

Please send all BIP-related email to the BIP editor, which is listed under [[#BIP_Editors|BIP Editors]] below. Also see [[#BIP_Editor_Responsibilities__Workflow|BIP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow]].\n+The BIP process begins with a new idea for Bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have a champion -- someone who writes the BIP using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The BIP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is BIP-able. Posting to the [https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev bitcoin-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org] mailing list (and maybe the [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=6.0 Development & Technical Discussion] forum) is the best way to go about this.\n \n-Authors MUST NOT self assign numbers, but should use an alias such as \"bip-johndoe-infinitebitcoins\" which includes the author's name/nick and the BIP subject.\n+Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a BIP is meant to both save the potential author and the wider community time. Many ideas have been brought forward for changing Bitcoin that have been rejected for various reasons. Asking the Bitcoin community first if an idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching the internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in most areas where Bitcoin is used. Small enhancements or patches often don't need a BIP and can be injected into the relevant Bitcoin development work flow with a patch submission to the relevant Bitcoin issue tracker.",
