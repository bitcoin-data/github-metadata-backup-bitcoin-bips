Links again here:\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\nhttps://github.com/instagibbs/bolts/commits/zero_fee_commitment\r\nhttps://github.com/instagibbs/lightning/commits/commit_zero_fees\r\n\r\nTLDR: trimmed value can go into the anchor itself, and is simply spent to fees by the spender.\r\n\r\n> Otherwise a time-sensitive package can be tampered by third-parties entering into replacement cycling games, without being a direct off-chain counterparty to the target transaction traffic.\r\n\r\nIn the BIP I can mention that it allows any party to spend, therefore any party can attempt a cycling attack. We're not going to agree on the severity of the attack, so it's up to implementer to do their own research.",

      "body": "> TLDR: trimmed value can go into the anchor itself, and is simply spent to fees by the spender.\r\n\r\nI believe this is broken - Let’s say you have Alice and Bob sharing a Lightning channel, with `max_accepted_htlcs` (483) on both sides. Alice is a routing hop allowing HTLC forward going through Alice-Bob link. Bob circularly routes 483 offered HTLCs  of value 330 satoshis (total amount 159390 satoshis). Those HTLCs are symmetrically committed on both Alice and Bob states. Assuming Bob can broadcast privately to a [transaction accelerator](https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/) with a child pocketing the anchor itself, Bob can mine the commitment transaction and steals 159390 satoshis from Alice’s balance.\r\n\r\nThanks to correct me if my understanding of `option_commit_zero_fee` is incorrect.\r\n\r\nAs of today, Bob could do the same attack by routing the HTLCs, however as the trimmed HTLCs are committed as miner fees, if Bob does not have low-hashrate capabilities, he cannot steal from Alice. Moving trimmed HTLC amounts from miners fees to a anyone-can-spend amount changes notably the threat model, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n> In the BIP I can mention that it allows any party to spend, therefore any party can attempt a cycling attack. We're not going > to agree on the severity of the attack, so it's up to implementer to do their own research.\r\n\r\nWhile I agree that we won’t agree on the severity of a replacement cycling attack, I disagree on the deference to put on implementers the responsibility to do their own research on the security of such proposal. Not only this is unfavorable practice for Internet protocol standardization works (all IETF RFCs must have mandatory security sections - RFC 3552), beyond for the given proposal it modifies the attacker incentives model as _anyone_ on the peer-to-peer transaction-relay network can enter into replacement cycling attacks against your time-sensitive packages or massive transaction batch.\r\n\r\nAllowing anyone to tamper with packages is not only an issue for the safety of your use-case funds, it does open the door to adversaries tamper with the global transaction traffic, with potential way to realize gains. In the past, [miners-harvesting attacks](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-November/019615.html) have been considered, and here it’s opening one. If you know that the transaction issuer of this transaction pattern will automatically fee-bump its package after X blocks without confirmation, anyone-can-spend ephemeral anchor allows you to substitute a “honest” CPFP at 20 sat/vbytes with a “malicious\" CPFP at 30 sat/vbytes and then evicts this CPFP to trigger an eviction of the 0-fee parent itself from network mempools.\r\n\r\nFor this last reason, I think that anyone-can-spend ephemeral anchor should be reconsidered and locking the ephemeral anchor under a counterparty pubkey should be introduced, as we’re doing with anchor outputs on lightning commitment transactions today. I understand the efficiency reasons to use an `OP_TRUE` though I’m unsure it’s worth the newly introduced safety weaknesses. ",

      "body": "> As of today, Bob could do the same attack by routing the HTLCs, however as the trimmed HTLCs are committed as miner fees, if Bob does not have low-hashrate capabilities, he cannot steal from Alice. Moving trimmed HTLC amounts from miners fees to a anyone-can-spend amount changes notably the threat model, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n@ariard it's an implementation detail for both Bitcoin Core and LN spec, but your hesitancy has caused me to look for a better solution than I was previously thinking: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/ephemeral-anchors-and-mev/383\r\n\r\n> While I agree that we won’t agree on the severity of a replacement cycling attack\r\n\r\nI'm fine adding some warning text wherever to inform implementors. Propose some please.\r\n\r\n> For this last reason, I think that anyone-can-spend ephemeral anchor should be reconsidered and locking the ephemeral anchor under a counterparty pubkey should be introduced, as we’re doing with anchor outputs on lightning commitment transactions today. I understand the efficiency reasons to use an OP_TRUE though I’m unsure it’s worth the newly introduced safety weaknesses.\r\n\r\nI think the story for keyless is much simpler, even if you personally disagree with the relative security of it.\r\n\r\nAnything that's relay-standard now would be a potential \"rug\" if it suddenly required you to be V3, that you must RBF all sibling spends, etc. If we instituted a rule anyways safely somehow, it may interfere with future relaxations where we don't care about dust(say, widespread utreexo deployment). Regardless today it also has a weaker anti-dust story as it can't be cleaned up except by key owners.\r\n\r\nWe're just not going to agree on this given our nearly year long discussions of cycle replacement attacks and similar, and it'll be up to others to weigh in on this point for specific use-cases. I apologize for not moving forward with this line of discussion from here on out.",

Policy is an individual per-node decision, not something standardized in itself.\r\n\r\nI suspect if this is a non-negotiable for this repo and this BIP editor (and hence won't get a BIP number) then we'll need a bips-policy repo or something (under the same GitHub organization perhaps). I get Luke's perspective to some extent (default policy proposals are certainly a very different animal to say consensus rule proposals) but this shouldn't be stunting collaboration between Core developers and Lightning developers on policy proposals. Personally I'd rather these draft proposals were incorporated into the BIP process but if that isn't going to happen then the documents need to be worked on in a different repo and with a different numbering system. Of course there is no guarantee these policy proposals will ever be merged into Core or an alternative implementation (they'd need to go through the Core etc review process to be merged) but that doesn't mean people can't draft and collaborate on proposals. Applies to #1541 too.",

A large number of BIPs are not relevant to node software, but they are Bitcoin-specific and should have canonical implementation-agnostic specifications and documentation for multiple people to refer to.",

I asked Luke about this on X/Twitter (it is public so I hope he doesn't mind me copying it over here) and he [responded](https://x.com/LukeDashjr/status/1749521346575360260?s=20):\r\n\r\n> \"Transaction pinning\" AFAIK is a _result_ of policy centralization efforts, not a real problem. The alternative is to encourage diverse policies, and at the technical level, to prepare multiple alternative transaction variants to ensure one being rejected won't be a problem.\r\n\r\nSo his perspective is not that BIPs need to be adopted by everybody or have to be consensus rules (as you state) but that he thinks attempts to standardize policy aren't a good idea and are perhaps even harmful. Again I personally disagree with that perspective (and I suspect everyone working on these proposals also disagree with that perspective) but just clarifying what Luke's perspective is.\r\n\r\n",

This ephemeral anchor is a \"mutex lock\" for the transaction,\n+allowing for robust fee bumping by wallets, not requiring any special key material\n+to do so, and avoiding all known transaction pinning vectors.\n+\n+===Motivation===\n+\n+One definition of transaction pinning is the intentional or unintentional blocking\n+of a getting a transaction mined that would otherwise be rational for the miner\n+to include in the next block without the attacker paying anything in many cases.\n+This can result in wallets simply not supporting fee bumping due to complexity,\n+or in certain smart contract cases such as Hash Time Locked Contracts, outright theft.\n+\n+[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28948 V3] transactions, which this proposal is built on, greatly mitigates [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki BIP125]\n+pinning vectors, where an adversary can vastly increase the required fees to replace a\n+transaction that will not be mined quickly, or disallow replacement altogether.\n+Depending on certain factors, this economic value can reach over 500 times increase\n+in required fees to replace the attacker's transaction. V3 transactions end\n+up reducing this attack surface by 100 times, resulting in 5 times increase in fees\n+using the same running example. This policy can be thought of as a \"RBF carve-out\".\n+\n+The major pinning vector left is \"package limit pinning\", where a counterparty\n+either maliciously or accidentally pins a transaction by exhausting the maximum\n+descendant limit of a transaction package using their own outputs, and is unwilling\n+or unable to get the package mined. This leaves the honest user unable to spend their\n+own outputs in the transaction package, as there is no RBF rule in place for evicting\n+\"sibling\" output spends from the same parent transaction.\n+\n+One existing mitigation for this issue is the [https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15681 CPFP carve out], which allows\n+a \"one more\" policy these limits, given some restrictions. This carve-out only works for\n+transactions with up to two immediately-spendable outputs. This leaves a lot to be\n+desired:\n+\n+* It does not solve many-party contract pinning, such as a three-party payment channel\n+* It does not solve batched payments pinning if the service is unable to double-spend its own inputs. For example, an exchange may require strict separation between client funds and fee funds for security reasons.\n+* In two-party smart contracts, all but two outputs must be relative-timelocked, which interferes with tooling such as [https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/ Miniscript] and smart contract composition such as making an output that is directly deposited into another smart contract or any wallet with standard address types.\n+* Perhaps most importantly, it is incompatible with future improvements to the mempool, particularly [https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27677 Cluster Mempools].\n+\n+This proposal gives a standard way to create a 0-fee \"parent\" transaction\n+which can be fee-bumped by any wallet by introducing a special 0-value anchor output\n+which MUST be spent within the same relay package.\n+\n+===Implications===\n+\n+In conjunction with V3 rules of a transaction having up to one child,\n+if a \"parent\" transaction has an ephemeral anchor, any spend of that parent transaction's\n+outputs must also include the ephemeral anchor spend in the same transaction, meaning it can\n+be double-spent by any other party via existing RBF rules. This \"mutex lock\" supersedes\n+the LN-focused CPFP carve-out, neatly solving the remaining issues with multiparty constructs and Miniscript\n+compatibility.\n+\n+===Expected Use Cases===\n+\n+* Batched payments with segregated fee pools: Batched payments that can be fee bumped without access to customer deposit related key material\n+* Simplified watchtowers: No requirement for watchtowers to be registered with privileged key material\n+* Payment accelerators: Users can submit transactions to transaction accelerators, who can fee bump using their own infrastructure\n+* Multiparty smart contracts: LN BOLTs can be revamped to remove `1 CSV` and value-sapping anchors.\n+* [https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/100537/what-is-spacechain Spacechains]\n+\n+===Unsolved Pinning Scenarios===\n+\n+One major class of pinning vectors yet unsolved is when the pre-signed transaction uses\n+SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY. This mode should be avoided as a pinning DoS is trivial.\n+\n+Second is any other transaction type such as coinjoins, where the wallet user doesn't\n+have \"veto\" power over all inputs in the transaction. A counterparty can double-spend\n+their inputs, and this can still result in a variety of pinning vectors, albeit\n+perhaps reduced in severity or chance of success.\n+\n+===Related Work===\n+\n+[https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-January/021334.html SIGHASH_GROUP] style proposals are an alternative method of bringing funds to a transaction without involving CPFP by enacting a softfork.
