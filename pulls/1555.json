    "body": "As Bitcoin has grown, the introduction of new address formats describing new forms of payment instructions has become increasingly fraught with compatibility issues. Not only does there exist traditional on-chain addresses, but some recipients wish to receive Lightning (when the sender supports it) or newer formats such as Silent Payments.\r\n\r\nThis has led to increasing use of the BIP 21 query parameters to encode further optional payment instructions.\r\n\r\nLooking forward, as new payment instructions get adopted, it makes much more sense to include them in query parameters rather than replace the existing address field, ensuring compatibility with senders and recipients who may or may not be upgraded to support all the latest payment instructions.\r\n\r\nThis updates BIP 21 to suggest that future address formats do this.\r\n\r\nFurther, it updates BIP 21 to allow an empty bitcoin address in cases where new payment instructions have moved to becoming mandatory. This isn't a backwards-incompatible change any more than switching to a new address format is, so doesn't impact existing BIP 21 implementations in a new way, however provides a nice conclusion to the query-parameter-based upgrade path - once a form of payment instructions has broad adoption, senders can simply drop the existing address field, keeping their existing query parameter encoding, rather than replace the existing address field. It also addresses the question of what to do if a wallet no longer wishes to receive some legacy on-chain address, but has multiple payment instruction formats that they wish to include - deciding which one to place in the address field would be a difficult task.",

      "body": "(Background discussion for context: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/revisiting-bip21/630)\r\n\r\nThanks for starting this! Conceptually, I agree with the updates but I think we can get a bigger win by advising the use of HRPs directly instead of key-value pairs. The benefits of this approach are:\r\n\r\n* Better taproot support: using HRPs directly would allow us to construct backwards compatible taproot URIs of the form `bitcoin:bc1q...?bc1p...=o` / `bitcoin:bc1q...?bc1p...`\r\n* Support for future payment instructions: any new payment protocol that encodes their payment instructions using bech32m can be included directly, e.g. `bitcoin:bc1q...?newprotocol1<bech32m encoded data>=o`\r\n* Existing unified QR codes can be made smaller: following an upgrade period to allow clients to update, we would be able to create URIs `bitcoin:bc1q...?lnbc1...=o` (instead of `?lightning=lnbc1...`) and fully static URIs `bitcoin:sp1q...?lno1...=o`\r\n\r\nFor senders, this simplifies implementing support for new address types in that clients can implement support for a generic BIP21 URI using HRPs as keys. As the client supports new bech32m encoded addresses, they are supported automatically without any additional changes.\r\n\r\nClients would still need to support new payment instructions that instead decided to use a query parameter, but I would expect most (if not all) clients to prefer bech32m encodings now that they get BIP21 support for free.\r\n\r\nI wrote a rough draft here, feel free use / modify as needed if you find it useful: https://github.com/josibake/bips/commit/07339bdb929113a9e7218f55ef1bfa72b3976f8e",

      "body": "@TheBlueMatt \r\n\r\n> my above claim is that there isn't any (more) difference of opinion :)\r\n\r\nI don't see the resolution to the discussion about bare keys vs key/values above, so it seems open to me, but perhaps you and @josibake hashed it out somewhere else (or I'm just misreading).  If it was resolved somewhere else public, I'd appreciate a link, as I was favoring several of Josie's proposals and I'd like to see what persuaded him to accept the full k/v approach.\r\n\r\n> BIPs are author documents - they aren't somehow blessed and implementers can do whatever they want\r\n\r\nBIPs in the _draft_ and _proposed_ stage are author documents for sure, but it doesn't seem clear to me that they should remain author documents once they enter the _final_ state.  If people implement a supposedly final specification and then the specification changes, that may unnecessarily lead to miscommunication.\r\n\r\n@ajtowns dealt with this problem in BINANAs by giving them revision numbers, so e.g. if I want to reference that a particular implementation of `OP_CAT` is based on the original proposal, I can say BIN24-1.0 and be protected against changes that become BIN24-1.1, etc.  We don't conveniently have that facility with BIPs (I'd have to refer to a commitish) and I think we deal with that by having a _final_ state after which significant changes are not expected.\r\n\r\n> I'm okay with just saying \"no changes at all\", but I think your position that we can make some changes (to describe reality) but not others (to provide forward-looking guidance) results in a pretty bad outcome.\r\n\r\nI'm also ok with \"no changes at all\".  That said, I think describing reality, especially if it's made clear that it differs from the original specification, is very advantageous to later implementers and those attempting to understand how their modern software works.  Not providing post-final forward-looking guidance in the updated BIP doesn't mean that we can't provide that guidance elsewhere, such as a new BIP or a link to a wiki page (in BIP125, I included a link to a [wiki page](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_replacement) to help foster collaboration among implementers and provide a source of living documentation).\r\n\r\nI do want to mention that none of the above is a hill I care to die on; it's just my opinion about editing _final_ BIPs.  If nobody else thinks this is a problem, I'm ok with this PR being merged as-is.",

However, I think in the case of _final_ BIPs, that ideal conflicts with the ideal of not giving anyone unnecessarily privileged access to the specification process.  If there is more than one reasonable way to do something, I don't think the author of a long-adopted spec should be able to use that spec to favor their preferred choices.\r\n\r\nWhich ideal is more important, better documentation or less privilege?  I don't know, which is why I'm ok with this PR being merged even if I'd prefer to see it reduced to only describing how current widely adopted behavior differs from the original spec.",

      "body": "> the ideal of not giving anyone unnecessarily privileged access to the specification process\n\nI'll be honest, I'd never considered that an ideal of the BIP process, including the reason for final BIPs. Of course no one should have some kind of priviledged access to changing Bitcoin, but the BIP process hasn't historically been the gate for that.\n\nAdmittedly I'm not quite sure what ideal/goal we seek to meet with having a \"final\" state - I'd always considered it to exist because we don't have a concept of an \"accepted\" BIP (because the BIP process isn't for \"accepting\" ideas), but we still need some way to mark something as different from \"draft\"/proposed. In that context, the \"final\" concept only really makes any sense for consensus change BIPs. You could argue that a BIP in sufficient adoption is \"final\" in that future changes don't make sense as they invalidate existing implementations which makes no sense, but that doesn't really answer what to do about forward guidance as is proposed here (presumably it's fine?)",

      "message": "Update BIP XXXX with information about more modern usage of it\n\nAs Bitcoin has grown, the introduction of new address formats\ndescribing new forms of payment instructions has become\nincreasingly fraught with compatibility issues. Not only does there\nexist traditional on-chain addresses, but some recipients wish to\nreceive Lightning (when the sender supports it) or newer formats\nsuch as Silent Payments.\n\nThis has led to increasing use of the BIP 21 query parameters to\nencode further optional payment instructions.\n\nLooking forward, as new payment instructions get adopted, it makes\nmuch more sense to include them in query parameters rather than\nreplace the existing address field, ensuring compatibility with\nsenders and recipients who may or may not be upgraded to support\nall the latest payment instructions.\n\nThis updates BIP XXX to suggest that future address formats do this.\n\nFurther, it updates BIP XXX to allow an empty bitcoin address in\ncases where new payment instructions have moved to becoming\nmandatory. This isn't a backwards-incompatible change any more than\nswitching to a new address format is, so doesn't impact existing\nBIP 21 implementations in a new way, however provides a nice\nconclusion to the query-parameter-based upgrade path - once a form\nof payment instructions has broad adoption, senders can simply drop\nthe existing address field, keeping their existing query parameter\nencoding, rather than replace the existing address field. It also\naddresses the question of what to do if a wallet no longer wishes\nto receive some legacy on-chain address, but has multiple payment\ninstruction formats that they wish to include - deciding which one\nto place in the address field would be a difficult task.",

The merchant publishes an *invoice_request* which contains offer fields\r\n   which refer to its attempt to send money, including an amount.\r\n2. The user sends an *invoice* over the lightning network for the amount in the\r\n   *invoice_request*, using a (possibly temporary) *invoice_node_id*.\r\n3. The merchant confirms the *invoice_node_id* to ensure it's about to pay the correct\r\n   person, and makes a payment to the invoice.\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith more explanation later on....\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rustyrussell/lightning-rfc/blob/db73bbb64d2dfc07fbc9c1dc09259d827f703868/12-offer-encoding.md?plain=1#L367\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe second case is publishing an `invoice_request` without an offer,\r\nsuch as via QR code.  It contains neither `offer_issuer_id` nor `offer_paths`, setting the\r\n`invreq_payer_id` (and possibly `invreq_paths`) instead, as it in the one paying: the\r\nother offer fields are filled by the creator of the `invoice_request`,\r\nforming a kind of offer-to-send-money.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n",

That is literally stated in the spec that I quoted above.\r\n> \r\n> I believe its just a stale line that has slipped in. There is now a dedicated \"refund\" type which addresses that use-case. Thanks for reporting [lightning/bolts#798 (comment)](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/798#discussion_r1765062764)\r\n> \r\n\r\nLooking at @rustyrussell's reply, it seems as there is no explicit refund workflow, it is instead just a modified use case of the offer workflow that can use used for refunds if you want to. So, in that use case, yes, I do think that `invoice_requests` are intended to be published. Do you agree?\r\n\r\n\r\n> > Are you saying that the key lnr is already supported automatically by your new BIP because of its generality?\r\n> \r\n> Yep!\r\n\r\nGreat, what is cool about this once this is supported by wallets, you can basically make QR code and a paper note with this standard and pass that around to people similar to a paper check, redeemable instantly from your lightning node! This is a great way to make backup in case your phone gets smashed before going on a trip. You can make notes in many denominations and destroy them whenever you want.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "[BIP-0353](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0353.mediawiki) uses this BIP (even though it says it uses BIP-0021). This BIP (and BIP-21) result in long URI. This presents a problem for QR code encoding and just simple writing of them in messages, etc. Wondering if we can have another URI form that will resolve a BIP-0353 address? For example, encoding something such as `bip353:matt@mattcorallo.com` is much shorter than `bitcoin:bc1qztwy6xen3zdtt7z0vrgapmjtfz8acjkfp5fp7l?lno=lno1qsg95t28fvk7aefdum96rgwq3psqzyxvqfcsq3pv8dulvphcpuezmxx5n8h0evrqtx00ch2wevqzp8pvk4qeqqhw37mc9659ses3xkamaksfd9dspq6gkgmvzcl7eppzd3er2w80rgpq9ys6szwh4e33p82jmu42e9zgay44rhg6whr4gq9l6xe6jd7penguqqeua845ptusy3xs5wxwrytm9ck6dh8l739jmw2rfsu8nudvtef90hfn4aj55aw0ezxxf2excmead9vaqvjtuq6s9a580e85rz8mdvp26kuc5vr2llmuexrgxhxx66l400275a3535qpqvemxtpdvuvrwh83qkjl53eagqckyypeq87wey4833z750a5kr5ppfzemeuhtemw6jpty2gznf76zakkj0c`. BIP-353 suggests using `₿matt@mattcorallo.com`, but will that work for triggering apps with QR codes, clickable links, NFC intent on phones? Could we change it to `₿:matt@mattcorallo.com` (but is that a valid link prefix type, and even if it is, is it easy for people to type?)? Alternatively, could we use `BTC:matt@mattcorallo.com` as a link prefix for BIP-0353?\r\n\r\nPossibly this discussion is about BIP-0353 and not a replacement to BIP-0021, but I'm not sure of the latest discussion area for BIP-353 since it is already issued and it doesn't really pertain to URI prefixes that trigger applications from the operating system, only how wallet applications should behave inside themselves.",

The query parameter keys are also case-insensitive. Query parameter values and bitcoin address fields may be case-sensitive depending on their content.\n+\n+=== Bitcoin Address ===\n+\n+The bitcoinaddress body MUST be either a base58 P2SH or P2PKH address, bech32 Segwit version 0 address, bech32m Segwit address, or empty.

Thus, it is recommended that additional variables prefixed with req- not be used in a mission-critical way until a grace period of 6 months from the finalization of this BIP has passed in order to allow client developers to release new versions, and users of old clients to upgrade.\n+\n+Compared to BIP 21, this document describes standard query parameters containing payment instructions, allows bech32 and bech32m `bitcoinaddress` fields, and allow for future URIs with an empty `bitcoinaddress` field. Use of bech32 and bech32m `bitcoinaddress` fields were long-since common practice in 2024, and the `lightning` query parameter storing BOLT 11 payment instructions became common practice in the year or three leading up to 2024. Inclusion of standard query parameters was added to provide guidance on query parameter usage going forward.",

If there is already a registered handler, they MAY prompt the user to change it once when they first run the client.\n+\n+=== General Format ===\n+\n+Bitcoin URIs follow the general format for URIs as set forth in RFC 3986. The path component consists of a bitcoin address, and the query component provides additional payment options.\n+\n+Elements of the query component may contain characters outside the valid range.

The query parameter keys are also case-insensitive. Query parameter values and bitcoin address fields may be case-sensitive depending on their content.\n+\n+=== Bitcoin Address ===\n+\n+The bitcoinaddress body MUST be either a base58 P2SH or P2PKH address, bech32 Segwit version 0 address, bech32m Segwit address, or empty. Future address formats SHOULD instead be placed in query keys as optional payment instructions to provide backwards compatibility during upgrade cycles. After new address types are near-universally supported, or for recipients wishing to avoid a standard on-chain fallback, the bitcoinaddress part of the URI MAY be left empty.\n+\n+=== Query Keys ===\n+\n+The following keys are defined generally and apply to any URI regardless of payment instructions:\n+\n+*label: Label for that address (e.g. name of receiver)\n+*address: bitcoin address\n+*message: message that describes the transaction to the user ([[#Examples|see examples below]])\n+\n+The following keys are currently defined for payment instructions of various forms:\n+\n+*lightning: Lightning BOLT 11 invoices\n+*lno: Lightning BOLT12 offers\n+*sp: Silent Payment addresses\n+\n+New payment instructions using bech32 or bech32m encodings SHOULD reuse their address format's Human Readable Part as the parameter key.\n+\n+==== Transfer amount ====\n+\n+If an amount is provided, it MUST be specified in decimal BTC.\n+All amounts MUST contain no commas and use a period (.) as the separating character to separate whole numbers and decimal fractions.\n+I.e. amount=50.00 or amount=50 is treated as 50 BTC, and amount=50,000.00 is invalid.\n+\n+Bitcoin clients MAY display the amount in any format that is not intended to deceive the user.\n+They SHOULD choose a format that is foremost least confusing, and only after that most reasonable given the amount requested.\n+For example, so long as the majority of users work in BTC units, values should always be displayed in BTC by default, even if mBTC or TBC would otherwise be a more logical interpretation of the amount.\n+== Rationale ==\n+\n+===Payment identifiers, not person identifiers===\n+Best practices are that a unique address should be used for every transaction on-chain.\n+Therefore, a URI which contains an on-chain payment address MUST NOT represent an exchange of personal information, but a one-time payment instruction. URIs which represent only reusable non-address-reusing payment instructions (like Lightning BOLT12 offers or Silent Payments) MAY be reused as a wallet sees fit.\n+\n+===Accessibility (URI scheme name)===\n+Should someone from the outside happen to see such a URI, the URI scheme name already gives a description.\n+A quick search should then do the rest to help them find the resources needed to make their payment.\n+Other proposed names sound much more cryptic; the chance that someone googles that out of curiosity are much slimmer.\n+Also, very likely, what he will find are mostly technical specifications - not the best introduction to bitcoin.\n+\n+==Forward compatibility==\n+Variables which are prefixed with a req- are considered required.  If a client does not implement any variables which are prefixed with req-, it MUST consider the entire URI invalid.  Any other variables which are not implemented, but which are not prefixed with a req-, can be safely ignored.\n+\n+As future new address types should be added using query parameters rather than the `bitcoinaddress` field, URIs can seamlessly support many payment instructions while senders only support legacy instructions. This allows for senders to be able to pay newer recipients while still allowing the use of more modern payment instruction formats.\n+\n+==Backward compatibility==\n+As this BIP is written, several clients already implement a bitcoin: URI scheme similar to this one, however usually without the additional \"req-\" prefix requirement.  Thus, it is recommended that additional variables prefixed with req- not be used in a mission-critical way until a grace period of 6 months from the finalization of this BIP has passed in order to allow client developers to release new versions, and users of old clients to upgrade.\n+\n+Compared to BIP 21, this document describes standard query parameters containing payment instructions, allows bech32 and bech32m `bitcoinaddress` fields, and allow for future URIs with an empty `bitcoinaddress` field. Use of bech32 and bech32m `bitcoinaddress` fields were long-since common practice in 2024, and the `lightning` query parameter storing BOLT 11 payment instructions became common practice in the year or three leading up to 2024. Inclusion of standard query parameters was added to provide guidance on query parameter usage going forward.\n+\n+Any existing BIP 21 implementation should automatically be fully compliant with this BIP, as the changes only describe existing practice or impact future address format inclusion.\n+\n+== Appendix ==\n+\n+=== Simpler syntax ===\n+\n+This section is non-normative and does not cover all possible syntax.\n+Please see the BNF grammar above for the normative syntax.\n+\n+[foo] means optional, &lt;bar&gt; are placeholders\n+\n+ <nowiki>bitcoin:<address>[?amount=<amount>][?label=<label>][?message=<message>]</nowiki>\n+\n+=== Examples ===\n+\n+Just the address:\n+ bitcoin:175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W\n+\n+Address with name:\n+ bitcoin:175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W?label=Luke-Jr\n+\n+Request 20.30 BTC to \"Luke-Jr\":\n+ bitcoin:175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W?amount=20.3&label=Luke-Jr\n+\n+Request 50 BTC with message:\n+ bitcoin:175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W?amount=50&label=Luke-Jr&message=Donation%20for%20project%20xyz\n+\n+Request funds to be paid over lightning to a BOLT 11 invoice with a fallback to on-chain payments:\n+ bitcoin:175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W?lightning=lnbc420bogusinvoice\n+\n+Request funds to be paid over lightning to a BOLT 11 invoice with no fallback:\n+ bitcoin:?lightning=lnbc420bogusinvoice\n+\n+Request funds to be paid over lightning to a BOLT 12 offer with no fallback:\n+ bitcoin:?lno=lno1bogusoffer\n+\n+Request funds to be paid over lightning to a BOLT 12 offer or silent payments address with no fallback:\n+ bitcoin:?lno=lno1bogusoffer&sp=sp1qsilentpayment\n+\n+Request funds to be paid to a silent payments address with no fallback:\n+ bitcoin:?sp=sp1qsilentpayment\n+\n+Request funds to be paid to a silent payments address with a fallback:\n+ bitcoin:175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W?sp=sp1qsilentpayment\n+\n+Some future version that has variables which are (currently) not understood and required and thus invalid:\n+ bitcoin:175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W?req-somethingyoudontunderstand=50&req-somethingelseyoudontget=999\n+\n+Some future version that has variables which are (currently) not understood but not required and thus valid:\n+ bitcoin:175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W?somethingyoudontunderstand=50&somethingelseyoudontget=999\n+\n+Characters must be URI encoded properly.\n+\n+== Reference Implementations ==\n+=== Bitcoin clients ===\n+* Bitcoin-Qt supports the old version of Bitcoin URIs (ie without the req- prefix), with Windows and KDE integration as of commit 70f55355e29c8e45b607e782c5d76609d23cc858.\n+\n+=== Libraries ===\n+* Javascript - https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bip21\n+* Java - https://github.com/SandroMachado/BitcoinPaymentURI\n+* Swift - https://github.com/SandroMachado/BitcoinPaymentURISwift",

BIP 21 was based on BIP 20, which was, in turn based off an earlier document by Nils Schneider.\n+\n+==Abstract==\n+This BIP proposes a URI scheme for making Bitcoin payments.\n+\n+==Motivation==\n+The purpose of this URI scheme is to enable users to easily make payments by simply clicking links on webpages or scanning QR Codes.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+=== General rules for handling (important!) ===\n+\n+Bitcoin clients MUST NOT act on URIs without getting the user's authorization.\n+They SHOULD require the user to manually approve each payment individually, though in some cases they MAY allow the user to automatically make this decision.\n+\n+=== Operating system integration ===\n+Graphical bitcoin clients SHOULD register themselves as the handler for the \"bitcoin:\" URI scheme by default, if no other handler is already registered. If there is already a registered handler, they MAY prompt the user to change it once when they first run the client.\n+\n+=== General Format ===\n+\n+Bitcoin URIs follow the general format for URIs as set forth in RFC 3986. The path component consists of a bitcoin address, and the query component provides additional payment options.\n+\n+Elements of the query component may contain characters outside the valid range. These must first be encoded according to UTF-8, and then each octet of the corresponding UTF-8 sequence must be percent-encoded as described in RFC 3986.\n+\n+=== ABNF grammar ===\n+\n+(See also [[#Simpler syntax|a simpler representation of syntax]])\n+\n+ bitcoinurn     = \"bitcoin:\" [ bitcoinaddress ] [ \"?\" bitcoinparams ]\n+ bitcoinaddress = *base58 / *bech32 / *bech32m\n+ bitcoinparams  = bitcoinparam [ \"&\" bitcoinparams ]\n+ bitcoinparam   = [ amountparam / labelparam / messageparam / otherparam / reqparam ]\n+ amountparam    = \"amount=\" *digit [ \".\" *digit ]\n+ labelparam     = \"label=\" *qchar\n+ messageparam   = \"message=\" *qchar\n+ otherparam     = qchar *qchar [ \"=\" *qchar ]\n+ reqparam       = \"req-\" qchar *qchar [ \"=\" *qchar ]\n+\n+Here, \"qchar\" corresponds to valid characters of an RFC 3986 URI query component, excluding the \"=\" and \"&\" characters, which this BIP takes as separators.\n+\n+The scheme component (\"bitcoin:\") is case-insensitive, and implementations must accept any combination of uppercase and lowercase letters. The query parameter keys are also case-insensitive. Query parameter values and bitcoin address fields may be case-sensitive depending on their content.\n+\n+=== Bitcoin Address ===\n+\n+The bitcoinaddress body MUST be either a base58 P2SH or P2PKH address, bech32 Segwit version 0 address, bech32m Segwit address, or empty. Future address formats SHOULD instead be placed in query keys as optional payment instructions to provide backwards compatibility during upgrade cycles. After new address types are near-universally supported, or for recipients wishing to avoid a standard on-chain fallback, the bitcoinaddress part of the URI MAY be left empty.\n+\n+=== Query Keys ===\n+\n+The following keys are defined generally and apply to any URI regardless of payment instructions:\n+\n+*label: Label for that address (e.g. name of receiver)\n+*address: bitcoin address\n+*message: message that describes the transaction to the user ([[#Examples|see examples below]])\n+\n+The following keys are currently defined for payment instructions of various forms:\n+\n+*lightning: Lightning BOLT 11 invoices\n+*lno: Lightning BOLT12 offers\n+*sp: Silent Payment addresses\n+\n+New payment instructions using bech32 or bech32m encodings SHOULD reuse their address format's Human Readable Part as the parameter key.\n+\n+==== Transfer amount ====\n+\n+If an amount is provided, it MUST be specified in decimal BTC.\n+All amounts MUST contain no commas and use a period (.) as the separating character to separate whole numbers and decimal fractions.\n+I.e. amount=50.00 or amount=50 is treated as 50 BTC, and amount=50,000.00 is invalid.\n+\n+Bitcoin clients MAY display the amount in any format that is not intended to deceive the user.\n+They SHOULD choose a format that is foremost least confusing, and only after that most reasonable given the amount requested.\n+For example, so long as the majority of users work in BTC units, values should always be displayed in BTC by default, even if mBTC or TBC would otherwise be a more logical interpretation of the amount.\n+== Rationale ==\n+\n+===Payment identifiers, not person identifiers===\n+Best practices are that a unique address should be used for every transaction on-chain.\n+Therefore, a URI which contains an on-chain payment address MUST NOT represent an exchange of personal information, but a one-time payment instruction. URIs which represent only reusable non-address-reusing payment instructions (like Lightning BOLT12 offers or Silent Payments) MAY be reused as a wallet sees fit.\n+\n+===Accessibility (URI scheme name)===\n+Should someone from the outside happen to see such a URI, the URI scheme name already gives a description.\n+A quick search should then do the rest to help them find the resources needed to make their payment.\n+Other proposed names sound much more cryptic; the chance that someone googles that out of curiosity are much slimmer.\n+Also, very likely, what he will find are mostly technical specifications - not the best introduction to bitcoin.\n+\n+==Forward compatibility==\n+Variables which are prefixed with a req- are considered required.  If a client does not implement any variables which are prefixed with req-, it MUST consider the entire URI invalid.  Any other variables which are not implemented, but which are not prefixed with a req-, can be safely ignored.\n+\n+As future new address types should be added using query parameters rather than the `bitcoinaddress` field, URIs can seamlessly support many payment instructions while senders only support legacy instructions. This allows for senders to be able to pay newer recipients while still allowing the use of more modern payment instruction formats.\n+\n+==Backward compatibility==\n+As this BIP is written, several clients already implement a bitcoin: URI scheme similar to this one, however usually without the additional \"req-\" prefix requirement.  Thus, it is recommended that additional variables prefixed with req- not be used in a mission-critical way until a grace period of 6 months from the finalization of this BIP has passed in order to allow client developers to release new versions, and users of old clients to upgrade.\n+\n+Compared to BIP 21, this document describes standard query parameters containing payment instructions, allows bech32 and bech32m `bitcoinaddress` fields, and allow for future URIs with an empty `bitcoinaddress` field. Use of bech32 and bech32m `bitcoinaddress` fields were long-since common practice in 2024, and the `lightning` query parameter storing BOLT 11 payment instructions became common practice in the year or three leading up to 2024. Inclusion of standard query parameters was added to provide guidance on query parameter usage going forward.\n+\n+Any existing BIP 21 implementation should automatically be fully compliant with this BIP, as the changes only describe existing practice or impact future address format inclusion.\n+\n+== Appendix ==\n+\n+=== Simpler syntax ===\n+\n+This section is non-normative and does not cover all possible syntax.\n+Please see the BNF grammar above for the normative syntax.",
