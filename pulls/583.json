It just follows the rules, creates the tx for signing and signs, then adds the signature binary data to the data chunk (URI or otherwise)\r\n> \r\n> After thinking a lot, there should also be perhaps two separate related BIPs on relay methods and initialization methods.\r\n> \r\n> ie. Which methods are supported? If we recommend a JSON API, what are the necessary endpoints? Do we support IP direct connection or not? etc. Should there be voluntary discovery like Electrum nodes? Etc etc\r\n> \r\n> ie. How do you set up the configuration and share it between wallets? How do you \"backup\" the configurations (having such freedom means that private keys are not our only worry anymore, we must remember which private key was a member of what type of wallet and where is the metadata stored if any (a la Copay stores in BWS)\r\n> \r\n> I think we could make these three BIPs encompass a large possibility space to allow for true wallet interoperability rather than just have it be a way to encode the same old cookie cutter transactions by using previous knowledge of a popular template etc.\r\n",

Redeem scripts and witness scripts spent to by an output in this transaction are included so that the user can verify that the transaction they are signing is creating the correct outputs that have the correct redeem and witness scripts. This is best used when the PSBT creator is not trusted by the signers.\r\n\r\n:heart: \r\n\r\nACK,  as discussed on IRC,  with this added I don't think an outputs extension is as necessary as you can now verify what outputs might be (P2WSH etc).\r\n\r\nThe negotiation of the outputs themselves is still out of band,  but I think we have agreed for now that that may be out of scope,  and or could easily be added in an extension.",
