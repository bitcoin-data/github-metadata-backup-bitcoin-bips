    "body": "BIP3 got a bit more review from @RubenSomsen, @darosior, and @jonatack. Thanks!\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the review. Most of it related to minor phrasing improvements, typos, and added emphasis.\r\n\r\nI also added mention of the Version header and Changelog to the Backward Compatibility section which I had overlooked, and explain why I consider the headers \"Superseded-by\" and \"Replaces\" asymmetric, and only propose a new name for \"Superseded-by\" but retain \"Replaces\".\r\n\r\n**This PR includes a deletion and readdition of the entire BIP 3, so as to provide further reviewers a surface to leave [comments directly on the BIP text](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1819/commits/3ec810e7c483a3896ce3221e9da2920306736251).** These two commits will disappear without a trace when the PR is later squash-merged.",

It replaces [BIP 2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIP 2 was written in 2016.\n+This BIP revisits aspects of the BIP 2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, delineates the\n+BIP Types more clearly, and generalizes the BIP process to meet the community’s use of the repository.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the Bitcoin[^capitalization] community. The main topic is information and technologies that support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.,\n+[BIP 50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the Bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the Bitcoin protocol, peer-to-peer network, and client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be a means for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that Bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authors’ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the Bitcoin community. As a BIP progresses through the workflow, it becomes increasingly\n+ co-owned by the Bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Deputies\n+\n+Authors may want additional help with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Deputies to their BIP. Deputies are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as a point of contact for the BIP in the absence of the\n+authors. Deputies may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Deputies share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the Significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what Bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent Bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the Bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more Bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the Bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the Purpose of the BIPs Repository?\n+\n+The [BIPs repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository transparently records all changes to each BIP and\n+allows any community member to retain a complete copy of the archive easily.\n+\n+The BIPs repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+There is no formal or informal decision body that governs Bitcoin development or decides acceptance of BIPs. Bitcoin\n+development emerges from the participation of stakeholders across the ecosystem.\n+\n+## BIP Format and Structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+Authors may choose to submit BIPs in MediaWiki or Markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, a _Copyright_, and a _Motivation_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate.\n+\n+* Preamble — Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP Header Preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract — A short description of the issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation — Why is this BIP being written? Clearly explain how the existing situation presents a problem and why the proposed idea resolves the\n+  issue or improves upon the current situation.\n+* Specification — The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any Bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale — The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what inspired the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered.

It replaces [BIP 2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIP 2 was written in 2016.\n+This BIP revisits aspects of the BIP 2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, delineates the\n+BIP Types more clearly, and generalizes the BIP process to meet the community’s use of the repository.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the Bitcoin[^capitalization] community. The main topic is information and technologies that support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.,\n+[BIP 50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the Bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the Bitcoin protocol, peer-to-peer network, and client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be a means for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that Bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authors’ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the Bitcoin community. As a BIP progresses through the workflow, it becomes increasingly\n+ co-owned by the Bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Deputies\n+\n+Authors may want additional help with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Deputies to their BIP. Deputies are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as a point of contact for the BIP in the absence of the\n+authors. Deputies may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Deputies share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the Significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what Bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent Bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the Bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more Bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the Bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the Purpose of the BIPs Repository?\n+\n+The [BIPs repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository transparently records all changes to each BIP and\n+allows any community member to retain a complete copy of the archive easily.\n+\n+The BIPs repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+There is no formal or informal decision body that governs Bitcoin development or decides acceptance of BIPs. Bitcoin\n+development emerges from the participation of stakeholders across the ecosystem.\n+\n+## BIP Format and Structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+Authors may choose to submit BIPs in MediaWiki or Markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, a _Copyright_, and a _Motivation_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate.\n+\n+* Preamble — Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP Header Preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract — A short description of the issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation — Why is this BIP being written? Clearly explain how the existing situation presents a problem and why the proposed idea resolves the\n+  issue or improves upon the current situation.\n+* Specification — The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any Bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale — The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what inspired the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward Compatibility — Any BIP that introduces incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibities and their severity as well as provide instructions on how\n+  implementers and users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference Implementation — Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Test vectors must be provided in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)) under an acceptable license. The reference implementation can be provided in the BIP, as an auxiliary file, or per reference to a pull request that is expected to remain available permanently.\n+* Changelog — A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright — The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP Header Preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/).
