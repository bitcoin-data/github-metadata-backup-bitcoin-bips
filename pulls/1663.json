We recommend that BIP authors open an initial pull request against their personal BIPs repository while they are collecting their thoughts and iterating quickly by themselves, and only open a pull request against the main repository after they have shared their proposal with the mailing list and are seeking public review.",

Within this protocol, nodes can negotiate new\n+transaction relay mechanisms and policies.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+Peers supporting the v2 transaction relay protocol signal support by adverstising\n+the 13th bit service flag in the addr p2p messages (`ADDR` and `ADDRV2`).",

Within this protocol, nodes can negotiate new\n+transaction relay mechanisms and policies.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+Peers supporting the v2 transaction relay protocol signal support by adverstising\n+the 13th bit service flag in the addr p2p messages (`ADDR` and `ADDRV2`).\n+\n+==Backward compatibility==\n+\n+Older clients remain fully compatible and interoperable after this change.",
