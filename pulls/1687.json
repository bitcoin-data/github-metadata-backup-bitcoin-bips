    "body": "This BIP adds support for sending silent payments using PSBTs.\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple entities handling the PSBT that do not have access to some input private keys, a DLEQ proof by the signer may be added for other entities to verify the corresponding ECDH shares used to derive the output scripts were generated correctly. This is specified in BIP374. For the common case of a single entity that has access to all private keys, the DLEQ proof generation is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nSpending support is trivial and can be done with a modification to BIP370 to add a new input field for the tweak data.",

In case there are multiple participants, this leaks to all other participants which inputs were provided in bulk by one party. I was wondering if there might be better privacy properties if participants provide a separate share for each input, that way all subsequent participants do not know how previous inputs group if the PSBT is passed in a circle rather than shared with all participants after each step. Maybe I’m overthinking this, though.",

In particular, the output script of a silent payment cannot be computed until after all transaction inputs have been added.\n+Also, any inputs that the Signer has the private keys for must be signed with SIGHASH_ALL and all inputs must not have any scriptPubKeys with Segwit version > 1.\n+Additionally, the silent payment outputs computed by a signer must be verifiable to other entities.\n+Therefore, new fields and role responsibilities must be added to carry, compute, and verify the silent payment data.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+This document specifies new fields and new field inclusion/exclusion requirements.\n+\n+<tt>PSBT_OUT_SCRIPT</tt> is modified to be optional for outputs in silent payments capable PSBTs. If this field is not included in the output, then the field PSBT_OUT_SP_V0_INFO must be included.\n+\n+The new global types are defined as follows:\n+\n+{|\n+! Name\n+! <tt><keytype></tt>\n+! <tt><keydata></tt>\n+! <tt><keydata></tt> Description\n+! <tt><valuedata></tt>\n+! <tt><valuedata></tt> Description\n+! Versions Requiring Inclusion\n+!

For silent payment capable PSBTs, all silent payment outputs must use the PSBT_OUT_SP_V0_INFO instead of PSBT_OUT_SCRIPT as the output script when creating the unsigned transaction used for unique identification.\n+\n+==Roles==\n+\n+This document modifies some existing roles.\n+\n+===Constructor===\n+\n+All rules must be followed from PSBTv2 for this role, with the following exception:\n+When an output is added, it must have either PSBT_OUT_SCRIPT or PSBT_OUT_SP_V0_INFO, or both, set.\n+\n+Additionally to PSBTv2, the Constructor must also follow additional rules:\n+\n+Inputs spending an output with script using Segwit version > 1 may only be added if there are no outputs with PSBT_OUT_SP_V0_INFO set.\n+Outputs with PSBT_OUT_SP_V0_INFO set may only be added if there are no inputs spending an output script using Segwit version > 1.\n+\n+===Signer===\n+\n+All rules must be followed from PSBTv2 for this role. If there are any outputs with PSBT_OUT_SP_V0_INFO set, then the following additional rules must also be adhered to:\n+\n+If any input is spending an output with script using Segwit version > 1, the Signer must fail.\n+\n+For all outputs with PSBT_OUT_SP_V0_INFO set, the Signer should:\n+ - Compute and set an ECDH share and DLEQ proof using all inputs it has the private key for.\n+ - Verify the DLEQ proofs for all inputs it does not have the private keys for.\n+ - If all eligible inputs have an ECDH share, compute and set the PSBT_OUT_SCRIPT.\n+\n+If the Signer sets any missing PSBT_OUT_SCRIPTs, it must set the Inputs Modifiable flag to False.\n+\n+If any output does not have PSBT_OUT_SCRIPT set, the Signer must not yet add a signature.\n+\n+The Signer should additionally compute the silent payment addresses, optionally showing this data to the user instead of the computed segwit v1 addresses.\n+\n+If a sighash type is provided and there are silent payment outputs present, the signer must fail if the sighash type is not SIGHASH_ALL.\n+If a sighash type is not provided and there are silent payment outputs present, the signer must sign using SIGHASH_ALL.\n+\n+====Computing the DLEQ Proof====\n+\n+For each output with PSBT_OUT_SP_V0_INFO set, the Signer may generate a proof for other entities to generate the output scripts and verify that the output scripts were generated correctly.\n+\n+Generate a global ECDH share for each scan key ''B<sub>scan</sub>'' and all eligible inputs the Signer has private keys for as follows:\n+\n+Using the notation from [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0352.mediawiki#specification BIP352]\n+\n+* Let ''A<sub>n</sub>'' be the sum of the public keys ''A'' of all eligible inputs\n+* Let ''a<sub>n</sub>'' be the sum of the private keys ''a'' of all eligible inputs\n+* Let ''C =  a<sub>n</sub>·B<sub>scan</sub>''\n+\n+Use a key ''B<sub>scan</sub>'' followed by a list of the outpoints of all eligible inputs.\n+\n+Set the value for the key of PSBT_GLOBAL_SP_ECDH_SHARE to ''C''.\n+\n+Compute the DLEQ proof for ''C'' using ''a<sub>n</sub>'' and ''B<sub>scan</sub>''.\n+Set the value for the key of PSBT_GLOBAL_SP_DLEQ to the proof.\n+\n+====Verifying the DLEQ Proof====\n+\n+For each output with PSBT_OUT_SP_V0_INFO set, the Signer should verify the ECDH shares for all eligible inputs it does not have the private key for using the proofs provided by other Signers.\n+\n+====Computing the Output Scripts====\n+\n+Compute the PSBT_OUT_SCRIPT using the procedure in [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0352.mediawiki#user-content-Creating_outputs BIP352] but substituting ''a·B<sub>scan</sub>'' with the sum of all PSBT_GLOBAL_SP_ECDH_SHAREs for that scan key.\n+If there are multiple silent payment codes with the same scan key, sort the codes lexicographically in ascending order to determine the ordering of the ''k'' value.\n+If there are multiple silent payment codes with both the same scan and spend keys, sort the subgroup by output index in ascending order.\n+\n+====Change Detection====\n+\n+Updaters may add two PSBT_OUT_BIP32_DERIVATION key-value-pairs with the corresponding derivation path of both the scan and spend keys. The Signer can then use these fields to verify that the silent payment code is change.",

      "body": "This seems to imply any subset of the inputs can be specified, presumably for grouping by owner.\r\n\r\nThe main advantage over allowing only one outpoint per ECDH share seems to be a reduction in proving complexity for signers who choose to provide DLEQ proofs, since the 36 byte outpoint outweighs a `a * B_scan` if it were provided in a per input field with an output index or even B_scan as the keydata.\r\n\r\nSome disadvantages:\r\n\r\n1. Mostly theoretical privacy concern: the DLEQ proof is publicly verifiable, and so much stronger heuristic for common ownership than the traditional common input ownership heuristic. Other parties or observers of the PSBT might store or leak such values, which hurts Signers' deniability.\r\n2. If the outpoint lists are not disjoint, then the correct sum might not be computable even if all inputs are accounted for by some share. If every ECDH_SHARE corresponded to only a single outpoint, as long as each signer contributes a value for each input, in any order, the sum can always be computed. If users modify a PSBT over multiple devices with partly overlapping access to private keys, single input shares ensure all intermediate states can lead to a fully signed state, regardless of the order in which the user proceeded.",

If you want to have a signer sign all non-eligible inputs with `SIGHASH_NONE`, give the signer the inputs before adding any silent payment outputs. It would then fall back to BIP 370.\r\nSigning with `SIGHASH_SINGLE` would allow another participant to add a payment to the same scan key, but a lower lexicographic order, invalidating the `k` value in the output script.\r\nSigning with `SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY` is unsafe as per BIP 352.\r\n\r\nI suppose I could add this as a footnote.\r\nBut also, I don't think this sentence should be in the motivation section.",

      "body": "> The main advantage over allowing only one outpoint per ECDH share seems to be a reduction in proving complexity for signers who choose to provide DLEQ proofs\r\n\r\nThe main advantage is reduction in both ECDH share generation and proving complexity.\r\nAll outpoint private keys can be summed, and then only a single ECC mult for the shares, and 2 ECC mults for the proof.\r\n\r\nConsider the common case of a single sig wallet using a hardware signing device receiving many small inputs over time. The wallet now contains 100 utxos and wants to spend to a single silent payment address.\r\nBy using single share and proof for each outpoint, that is 100 * ECDH share + 100 * DLEQ proof (2 ECC mults) + 100 * signatures = 400 ECC mults.\r\nBy summing all inputs, the result is now 1 * ECDH share + 1 * DLEQ proof (2 ECC mults) + 100 signatures = 103 ECC mults.\r\nOn a simple hardware signing device, this makes the signing time 4x, making it potentially a few minutes to over 10.\r\n\r\nre: disadvantages\r\n1. It is only an option to combine the inputs. You can still provide a share and proof per input or whatever combination of inputs you'd like. I will make this more clear in the text. I believe the single sig with hardware wallet is the most common case though, so we should optimize for that case.\r\n2. This is indeed a potential pitfall. It could also be addressed by providing a share and proof per input as a fallback. I will add some text to address this situation.",

This is an improvement over my implied suggestion as batched multiplication be used, but it does not reduce it to a single multiplication. Admittedly I don't yet see how to actually attack soundness as a malicious prover, especially when the prover does not control the choice of the the B_scan keys.\r\n\r\nThe batch proof I'm familiar with involves having an R point per generator, so same structure as proposed in the DLEQ BIP, just generalized from 2 to n+1 verification equations. When the proof is encoded as the challenge and the response, the encoding the n+1 R points is implicit, so the size would still be 64 bytes and both prover and verifier work is concretely reduced (~half the verification equations, and a shared challenge hash), but not asymptotically as the total work is still linear for both prover and verifier.",

      "body": "Using the mentioned protocol, \"RME-based common exponent Schnorr protocol\" (Henry14 3.2.3.3), the verifier performs 2+k ECC mults per proof, where k is the number of silent payment outputs, but the k mults can be shared for a batch of proofs, which large transactions can be a significant improvement in verifier complexity.\r\n\r\nCompared to this protocol the strawman protocol I described in the previous comment is broken in two ways, not just one:\r\n\r\n- two verification equations are needed, instead of only one (section 4.2 describes a lattice basis attack on soundness since the prover's responses are undetermined)\r\n- de-linearization (or in the multiplicative terms of Henry14, RME) is needed for soundness as well (see section 3.1.4.3)\r\n\r\nIn a non-interactive setting, the t_i terms of the random linear combination is generated by hashing.\r\n\r\nIf $t_i = H(B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_k)$ ($B_i$ is supposed to be `{B_{scan}}_i` but that apparently isn't in github's latex regex =P) the $k$ proofs would share the same delinearized sum $\\sum_{i=1}^k t_i B_i$, which appears as a term in the 2nd verification equation. This reduces $k^2$ ECC mults to $k$ (but asymptotically is the same because of other side of the equation still has a $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} t_i S_i$ term where $S_i = aB_i$ is a public input).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the full set of SP_V0_INFO fields to be finalized before DLEQ proofs can be computed in that case, but if I understand Lemma 3.5 I think the $t_i$ values used for this can be derived as $t_i = H(B_i)$ without destroying the proof of soundness. If this is correct then this reduction in verifier computation could be applied to batch-verify whatever $k$ batch-DLEQs, but number of roundtrips is not reduced because new proofs would be needed for the new outputs, and verifiers would need to be given explicit subsets of the outputs for each batch proof indicating what it covers, instead of being able to construct the proof statements implicitly from the set of all SP_V0_INFO fields, so it's not clear that this is a meaningful improvement over hashing all of the $B_i$s to delinearize.",

If there are any outputs with PSBT_OUT_SP_V0_INFO set, then the following additional rules must also be adhered to:\n+\n+If any input is spending an output with script using Segwit version > 1, the Signer must fail.\n+\n+For all outputs with PSBT_OUT_SP_V0_INFO set, the Signer should:\n+ - Compute and set an ECDH share and DLEQ proof using all inputs it has the private key for.\n+ - Verify the DLEQ proofs for all inputs it does not have the private keys for.\n+ - If all eligible inputs have an ECDH share, compute and set the PSBT_OUT_SCRIPT.\n+\n+If the Signer sets any missing PSBT_OUT_SCRIPTs, it must set the Inputs Modifiable flag to False.\n+\n+If any output does not have PSBT_OUT_SCRIPT set, the Signer must not yet add a signature.\n+\n+The Signer should additionally compute the silent payment addresses, optionally showing this data to the user instead of the computed segwit v1 addresses.\n+\n+If a sighash type is provided and there are silent payment outputs present, the signer must fail if the sighash type is not SIGHASH_ALL.\n+If a sighash type is not provided and there are silent payment outputs present, the signer must sign using SIGHASH_ALL.\n+\n+====Computing the DLEQ Proof====\n+\n+For each output with PSBT_OUT_SP_V0_INFO set, the Signer may generate a proof for other entities to generate the output scripts and verify that the output scripts were generated correctly.\n+\n+Generate a global ECDH share for each scan key ''B<sub>scan</sub>'' and all eligible inputs the Signer has private keys for as follows:\n+\n+Using the notation from [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0352.mediawiki#specification BIP352]\n+\n+* Let ''A<sub>n</sub>'' be the sum of the public keys ''A'' of all eligible inputs\n+* Let ''a<sub>n</sub>'' be the sum of the private keys ''a'' of all eligible inputs\n+* Let ''C =  a<sub>n</sub>·B<sub>scan</sub>''\n+\n+Use a key ''B<sub>scan</sub>'' followed by a list of the outpoints of all eligible inputs.",
