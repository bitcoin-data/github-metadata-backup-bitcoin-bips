    "body": "This is the amended Normalized Transaction ID BIP previously discussed\non the mailing list. Since the discussion on the mailing list there\nhave been some major changes, for one the BIP changed from requiring a\nhard-fork to a much easier soft-fork (thanks sipa for helping me\nfigure out how).\n\nThe normalized transaction IDs are computed on a stripped version of\nthe transaction, in which all the malleable parts, i.e., the\nsignatures, where removed. This solves malleability in a simple and\nclean way.\n\nUnlike the original proposal, this version does not use the normalized\ntransaction IDs on a network level, instead they are used solely when\nsigning and checking signatures. Normalized transactions are swapped\nin on-demand when using a new opcode OP_CHECKSIGEX and are tracked in\nthe UTXO, no longer requiring lookups by normalized transaction ID.\n\nIn order to give clear semantics when to track the normalized\ntransaction IDs and anchoring them without recursively computing the\nIDs of previous transactions down to the coinbases, the version is\nbumped to 2. Version 2 outputs may be referenced using the normalized\ntransaction IDs, while nothing changes for version 1 transactions.\n\nThere is a working implementation of this BIP in my [normtx\nbranch](https://github.com/cdecker/bitcoin/tree/normtx).\n",

If we leave the malleable transaction IDs in there we only achieve a non-malleability of 1 level beyond what is confirmed in the blockchain.\n\nHowever that means that in order to compute the normalized transaction ID we do need to have the previous outputs in our UTXO so that we can retrieve. Not a huge problem if we discard orphaned transactions anyway, just a minor drawback as I see it. I'll see if I can fix it in my implementation branch :-)\n\nAs for mimicking OP_CHECKSIG, isn't it sufficient to leave one non-null item on the top of the stack for old nodes to accept the script?\n",

For one it is computationally intensive to go through 60+ million transactions, some nodes no longer have all the data (purged blockchain) and I am not clear on what the advantage would be to track additional IDs for historic transactions.\n\nBumping v2 gives an easy way for future transactions to opt-into being tracked by normalized transaction ID as well.\n",

Computing the normalized transaction IDs for existing outputs therefore would just increase  the number of normalized transaction IDs we have to track.\n\nThe fact that people upgrading after the first v2 transactions appear have to rescan part of the blockchain is bad, but it only affects people that did not upgrade in time, which hopefully will be a minority, unlike forcing a rescan on everybody.\n",

It complicates the logic a bit more, but you prevent the instant 20% blowup and requirement for reindexing when upgrading before this BIP takes effect (though if a miner lets in a v2 transaction beforehand, we're all screwed...).\n\nBy \"define normalized txids recursively\" I just mean ultimately using prevout's ntxids in the computation of spending ntxids, not whether this would be done for all of history too.\n",

My main motivation was that I don't want to use 4 opcodes (verify/non-verify & singlesig/multisig), but if we lose the flexibility of deciding whether we are doing a multisig based on the flags anyway it could be done using two opcodes.\n\nI still have a preference for the flags since it allows us to introduce more flags in the future and NOPs are pretty rare, so keeping as many as possible free for the future might be better.\n",

      "body": "+1 for Schnorr signatures\n+1 for singlesig = 1-of-1 multisig\n\nThe bitcoin/secp256k1 repo, which is vendorized into bitcoin, contains all the necessary code to enable creating and checking Schnorr signatures. I quite like the idea of enabling this signature scheme since we are touching a lot of signing code already with this PR and it would simply be swapping in the signing and checking code.\n\nMerging singlesig and multisig, so that singlesig is simply a 1-of-1, is also nice since it reduces the number of separate cases we have to treat. In addition Schnorr trivially allows m-of-m by summing up the public keys, resulting in a combined pubkey, and summing up the signatures into a comined sig, then the combined sig is a valid signature for the combined pubkey. So we can manage and combine m-of-m externally to bitcoin-core.\n\nm-of-n could continue using a list of pubkeys and signatures (with the addition of a bitmap for which pubkeys were used when signing), until a better scheme is implemented.\n\nSince we now handle a lot fewer cases (verify is mandatory, singlesig = multisig) it seems natural to drop the flags argument and replace it with a simple version integer. This way we still group all future signature checking opcodes by replacing a single OP_NOP, but the semantics are clearer: if the version is higher than what I support I just treat the checksig op as an OP_NOP, reestablishing the current softfork semantics. Version 1 would use Schnorr signatures and normalization.\n",

      "body": "I just fixed a few minor things and applied the changes we discussed:\n- Using a simple version flag that indicates what ruleset to use: allows us to group future signature checking opcodes without using a nop, and it is way simpler than having flags, this way we treat unknown versions as nops and maintain softfork semantics.\n- The first ruleset (version=1) uses normalized transaction IDs and Schnorr signatures.\n- Adding new standard multisig format for both m-of-n and 1-of-1 as proposed by Gavin, it's not a huge overhead and simplifies things. I'd like to defer more complex scenarios to future BIPs and keep this one simple.\n\nSince there have been no deal-breaking comments and most of the people commenting seem to agree that this proposal is useful I'd like to join @luke-jr in asking @gmaxwell to assign a BIP number :-)\n\nOpen questions:\n- Maybe we could lead the m-of-n sigscript with a bitmap indicating which keys were used? Currently we have to check combinations if I'm not mistaken.\n- Is the grouping of future signature checking opcodes with a version desired at all, or should I simply redefine OP_NOP4 as Schnorr + normalized without the option to do future versions? I quite like the grouping but I'm open for suggestions.\n\nI gave merging secp256k1 into my dev branch a shot, but it broke far too much for me to feel comfortable fixing it and not introduce bugs, I'll therefore keep ECDSA in my experimental implementation for now, and let @sipa do the merging, he knows best :-)\n",

My recommendation is that for multiple pubkey inputs there must be the same number of signature inputs, but signatures should be required to be empty (and so only take one byte) if not being used, or otherwise pass verification.\n\nI don't understand why luke's alternative proposal that avoids increasing the UTXO set size by 20%+ doesn't seem to have been given consideration. As it stands I would oppose this proposal in Bitcoin Core and in the Bitcoin network due to the apparently avoidable irreversibly increase in the UTXO set size.\n\nThis can use BIP130.\n",

      "body": "Yep, checking combinations is awful and we can avoid it either by having empty sigs signalling that we should skip this check or by having a bitmap telling us which pubkeys from the script pubkey to use.\n\nI quite like the alternative proposal, which would void any need to do normalization in the first place and basically implement segregated witnesses, however as you also pointed out on the mailing list there is simply no clean way to relaying the witnesses without breaking old clients. I have been discussing this with a few more people and simply couldn't come up with a good way to implement it. The reason it is not in this proposal is that the proposal is implemented and does work, while with the alternative proposal I'm not even sure there is a good solution that does not break everything.\n\nFor those who don't want to wade through the mailing list: the alternative proposal by @luke-jr and @gmaxwell would define the opcode in such a way that a transaction is accompanied with an external script (segregated witness) that is not part of the transaction itself. The checksig opcode would require the scriptsig to be empty, hence the transaction would already be normalized. Then we would execute the external script, the scriptsig (which is empty) and the script pubkey so that we get normal execution semantics.\nThe problem is that it is difficult to tell not-upgraded clients that they should now also relay the external script along with the transactions itself.\n\nIf there is a workable solution I'm more than happy to amend this proposal and include it.\n",

      "diff_hunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,120 @@\n+<pre>\n+  BIP: NN\n+  Title: Normalized TXID\n+  Author: Christian Decker <decker.christian@gmail.com>\n+  Status: Draft\n+  Type: Standards Track\n+  Created: 2015-10-14\n+</pre>\n+== Abstract ==\n+\n+This BIP describes the use of normalized transaction IDs (TXIDs) in order to eliminate transaction malleability, both in the third-party modification scenario as well as the participant modification scenario. The transaction ID is normalized by removing the signature scripts from transactions before computing its hash. The normalized transaction hashes are then used during the signature creation and signature verification of dependent transactions.\n+\n+== Motivation ==\n+\n+Transaction malleability refers to the fact that transactions can be modified, either by one of the signers by re-signing the transaction or a third-party by modifying the signature representation. This is a problem since any modification to the serialized representation also changes the hash of the transaction, which is used by spending transaction to reference the funds that are being transferred. If a transaction is modified and later confirmed by ending up in the blockchain all transactions that depended on the original transaction are no longer valid, and thus orphaned.\n+\n+BIPs 62<ref>[[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0062.mediawiki|BIP 62 - Dealing with malleability]]</ref> and 66<ref>[[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0066.mediawiki|BIP 66 - Strict DER signatures]]</ref> alleviate the problem of third-party modification by defining a canonical representation of the signatures. However, the checking the canonical representation is complex and may not eliminate all sources of third-party malleability. Furthermore, these BIPs do not address modifications by one of the signers, i.e., re-signing the transaction, because signers can produce any number of signatures due to the random parameter in ECDSA.\n+\n+This proposal eliminates malleability altogether by removing the malleable signatures from the hash used to reference the outputs spent by a transaction. The new hash used to reference an output is called the ''normalized transaction ID''. The integrity of all data that is used to reference the output is guaranteed by the signature itself, and any modification that would change the normalized transaction ID would also invalidate the signature itself.\n+\n+Besides eliminating transaction malleability as a source of problems it also allows the use of transaction templates. Transaction templates simplify higher level protocols and allows new uses. They allow an unsigned template transaction to be used as a basis for a sequence of transaction and only once the sequence matches the signers' expectations they provide the necessary signatures for the template to become valid, thus opting in to the sequence.\n+\n+== Specification ==\n+\n+The use of normalized transaction IDs is introduced as a softfork. The specification is divided into three parts:\n+\n+ - Computation of the normalized transaction ID\n+ - Introduction of a new extensible signature verification opcode to enable softfork deployment\n+ - Changes to the UTXO tracking to enable normalized transaction ID lookup\n+\n+=== Normalized Transaction ID computation ===\n+\n+In order to calculate the normalized transaction ID, the signature script is stripped from each input of the transaction of non-coinbase transactions. Stripping the signature script is achieved by setting the script's length to 0 and removing the <code>uchar[]</code> array from the <code>TxIn</code>.<ref>[[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_Specification#tx|Protocol Specification: TX]]</ref>\n+The normalized transaction ID is then computed as the <code>SHA 256</code> hash of the stripped transaction matching the existing transaction ID computation. The normalized transaction ID remains unchanged even if the signatures of the transaction are replaced/malleated and describe a class of semantically identical transactions. In the following we use ''transaction instance ID'' to refer to the transaction ID computed on the transaction including signatures. Normalized transaction IDs for coinbase transactions are computed with the signature script in the coinbase input, in order to avoid hash collisions.",

Normalized transaction IDs for coinbase transactions are computed with the signature script in the coinbase input, in order to avoid hash collisions.\n+\n+=== OP_CHECKSIGEX ===\n+This BIP introduces a new opcode <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> which replaces <code>OP_NOP4</code>. <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> subsumes <code>OP_CHECKSIG(VERIFY)</code> and <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIG(VERIFY)</code> and extends their semantics by allowing additional parameters.\n+\n+When executed <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> pops an integer from the top of the stack. This integer encodes the binary options which determine how <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> verifies signatures. The following table shows the possible flags at the time of writing:\n+\n+{| class=\"wikitable\"\n+!colspan=\"6\"|OP_CHECKSIGEX flags\n+|-\n+! Name\n+! Value\n+!

Refer to the developer documentation<ref>[[https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#p2pkh-script-validation|Developer Documentation - P2PKH Script Validation]]</ref> for their semantics.\n+\n+The existing <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIG</code> and <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY</code> have a bug<ref>[[https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#multisig|Developer Documentation - Multisig]]</ref> that pops one argument too many from the stack. This bug is not reproduced in the implementation of OP_CHECKSIGEX, so the canonical solution of pushing a dummy value onto the stack is not necessary.\n+\n+<code>SCRIPT_CHECKSIGEX_NORMALIZE</code> indicates that before computing the signaturehash, i.e., the hash that is signed, the transaction should be normalized by replacing all transaction IDs in the inputs by their normalized variants. The normalized transction IDs are computed as described in the next section. This normalization step is performed both when creating the signatures as well as when checking the signatures.\n+\n+In order to make use of the normalization feature, this BIP introduces two new standard transaction types\n+\n+    OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubkey hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_4 OP_CHECKSIGEX\n+\n+and \n+\n+    <num sigs> <pubkeys> <numpubkeys> OP_6 OP_CHECKSIGEX\n+\n+The first is the equivalent of the pay-to-pubkeyhash script with normalization (<code>OP_4 = SCRIPT_CHECKSIGEX_NORMALIZE</code>), while the second is the equivalent of the pay-to-multisig also with normalization (<code>OP_6 = SCRIPT_CHECKSIGEX_NORMALIZE | SCRIPT_CHECKSIGEX_MULTI</code>). The format of the <code>scriptSig</code> corresponds to the original version, with exception of omitting the dummy <code>OP_0</code> in the multisig case.\n+\n+=== Tracking Normalized Transaction IDs ===\n+\n+The transaction version is bumped to 2. The new version signals to clients receiving the transaction that they should track the normalized transaction ID along with the transaction instance ID in the unspent transaction output (UTXO) set. Upon receiving a version 2 transaction the client computes the normalized transaction ID, annotates the outputs with it, and adds them into the UTXO set indexed by the transaction instance ID as before. Transactions continue using the transaction instance ID to reference the outputs, but while checking the signature they may get normalized. All network messages continue to use the transaction instance ID to reference the transaction, specifically <code>inv</code>, <code>getdata</code>, <code>tx</code> and <code>block</code> messages still use transaction instance IDs, not the normalized transaction IDs.\n+\n+Outputs created by version 1 transactions are not annotated with the normalized transaction ID, and when normalizing the hashes in transaction inputs referencing version 1 outputs are not modified.\n+\n+== Rationale ==\n+\n+Normalized transaction IDs are provably non-malleable since no data is included in the signaturehash whose integrity is not also proven in the signature, thus any modification causing the hash to change will also invalidate the signature.\n+Normalized transactions are secure as they still use cryptographic hashes over all the semantic information of the transaction, i.e., the inputs, outputs and metadata, thus it is still computationally infeasible to cause a hash collision between transactions.\n+\n+There are a number of advantages to using normalized transaction IDs:\n+\n+* Like BIP 62 and BIP 66 it solves the problem of third-parties picking transactions out of the network, modifying them and reinjecting them, as was allegedly done to defraud MtGox<ref>[[http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/7e4a7f3f2991784786037285f4876f5c/malleability.pdf|Bitcoin Transaction Malleability and MtGox]]</ref>.\n+* ''m-of-n'' multisig outputs are often used in higher level protocols<ref>[[http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/716b955c130e6c703fac336ea17b1670/duplex-micropayment-channels.pdf|A Fast and Scalable Payment Network with Bitcoin Duplex Micropayment Channels ]]</ref><ref>[[http://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf|The Bitcoin Lightning Network:\n+Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments]]</ref> in which several parties sign a transaction. Without normalized transaction IDs it is trivial for one party to re-sign a transaction, hence changing the transaction hash and invalidating any transaction built on top of its outputs. Normalized transaction IDs force the ID not to change, even if a party replaces its signature.\n+* Many higher level protocols build structures of transactions on top of multisig outputs that are not completely signed. This is currently not possible without one party holding a fully signed transaction and then calculating the ID. It is desirable to be able to build successive transactions without one party collecting all signatures, and thus possibly lock in funds unilaterally. Normalized transaction IDs allow the use of transaction templates, i.e., completely unsigned transactions upon which further transactions can be built, and only once every party is assured the structure matches its expectations it signs the template, thus validating the template.\n+\n+The only occurence in which transactions can still be modified unilaterally is in the case <code>SIGHASH_NONE</code>, <code>SIGHASH_SINGLE</code> or <code>SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY</code> is used. This however is not problematic since in these cases the creator of the transaction explicitly allows modification.\n+\n+In case of a transaction becoming invalid due to one of the inputs being malleated it is necessary to modify the spending transaction to reference the modified transaction ID. However, the signatures, which only use the normalized IDs, remain valid as long as the semantics of the funding transaction remain unchanged. An observer in the network may fix the transaction and reinject a corrected version.\n+\n+Using version 2 for transactions is an explicit optin to the normalized ID tracking and a simple upgrade for existing clients. It avoids having to reprocess the entire blockchain and computing the normalized transaction IDs for existing outputs in the UTXO. This would be further complicated by having to recursively compute normalized transaction IDs down to the coinbase transactions which created the coins.",

The transaction ID is normalized by removing the signature scripts from transactions before computing its hash. The normalized transaction hashes are then used during the signature creation and signature verification of dependent transactions.\n+\n+== Motivation ==\n+\n+Transaction malleability refers to the fact that transactions can be modified, either by one of the signers by re-signing the transaction or a third-party by modifying the signature representation. This is a problem since any modification to the serialized representation also changes the hash of the transaction, which is used by spending transaction to reference the funds that are being transferred. If a transaction is modified and later confirmed by ending up in the blockchain all transactions that depended on the original transaction are no longer valid, and thus orphaned.\n+\n+BIPs 62<ref>[[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0062.mediawiki|BIP 62 - Dealing with malleability]]</ref> and 66<ref>[[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0066.mediawiki|BIP 66 - Strict DER signatures]]</ref> alleviate the problem of third-party modification by defining a canonical representation of the signatures. However, the checking the canonical representation is complex and may not eliminate all sources of third-party malleability. Furthermore, these BIPs do not address modifications by one of the signers, i.e., re-signing the transaction, because signers can produce any number of signatures due to the random parameter in ECDSA.\n+\n+This proposal eliminates malleability altogether by removing the malleable signatures from the hash used to reference the outputs spent by a transaction. The new hash used to reference an output is called the ''normalized transaction ID''. The integrity of all data that is used to reference the output is guaranteed by the signature itself, and any modification that would change the normalized transaction ID would also invalidate the signature itself.\n+\n+Besides eliminating transaction malleability as a source of problems it also allows the use of transaction templates. Transaction templates simplify higher level protocols and allows new uses. They allow an unsigned template transaction to be used as a basis for a sequence of transaction and only once the sequence matches the signers' expectations they provide the necessary signatures for the template to become valid, thus opting in to the sequence.\n+\n+== Specification ==\n+\n+The use of normalized transaction IDs is introduced as a softfork. The specification is divided into three parts:\n+\n+ - Computation of the normalized transaction ID\n+ - Introduction of a new extensible signature verification opcode to enable softfork deployment\n+ - Changes to the UTXO tracking to enable normalized transaction ID lookup\n+\n+=== Normalized Transaction ID computation ===\n+\n+In order to calculate the normalized transaction ID, the signature script is stripped from each input of the transaction of non-coinbase transactions. Stripping the signature script is achieved by setting the script's length to 0 and removing the <code>uchar[]</code> array from the <code>TxIn</code>.<ref>[[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_Specification#tx|Protocol Specification: TX]]</ref>\n+The normalized transaction ID is then computed as the <code>SHA 256</code> hash of the stripped transaction matching the existing transaction ID computation. The normalized transaction ID remains unchanged even if the signatures of the transaction are replaced/malleated and describe a class of semantically identical transactions. In the following we use ''transaction instance ID'' to refer to the transaction ID computed on the transaction including signatures. Normalized transaction IDs for coinbase transactions are computed with the signature script in the coinbase input, in order to avoid hash collisions.\n+\n+=== OP_CHECKSIGEX ===\n+This BIP introduces a new opcode <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> which replaces <code>OP_NOP4</code>. <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> subsumes <code>OP_CHECKSIG(VERIFY)</code> and <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIG(VERIFY)</code> and extends their semantics by allowing additional parameters.\n+\n+When executed <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> pops an integer from the top of the stack. This integer encodes the binary options which determine how <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> verifies signatures.

The new version signals to clients receiving the transaction that they should track the normalized transaction ID along with the transaction instance ID in the unspent transaction output (UTXO) set. Upon receiving a version 2 transaction the client computes the normalized transaction ID, annotates the outputs with it, and adds them into the UTXO set indexed by the transaction instance ID as before. Transactions continue using the transaction instance ID to reference the outputs, but while checking the signature they may get normalized. All network messages continue to use the transaction instance ID to reference the transaction, specifically <code>inv</code>, <code>getdata</code>, <code>tx</code> and <code>block</code> messages still use transaction instance IDs, not the normalized transaction IDs.\n+\n+Outputs created by version 1 transactions are not annotated with the normalized transaction ID, and when normalizing the hashes in transaction inputs referencing version 1 outputs are not modified.\n+\n+== Rationale ==\n+\n+Normalized transaction IDs are provably non-malleable since no data is included in the signaturehash whose integrity is not also proven in the signature, thus any modification causing the hash to change will also invalidate the signature.\n+Normalized transactions are secure as they still use cryptographic hashes over all the semantic information of the transaction, i.e., the inputs, outputs and metadata, thus it is still computationally infeasible to cause a hash collision between transactions.\n+\n+There are a number of advantages to using normalized transaction IDs:\n+\n+* Like BIP 62 and BIP 66 it solves the problem of third-parties picking transactions out of the network, modifying them and reinjecting them, as was allegedly done to defraud MtGox<ref>[[http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/7e4a7f3f2991784786037285f4876f5c/malleability.pdf|Bitcoin Transaction Malleability and MtGox]]</ref>.",

The transaction ID is normalized by removing the signature scripts from transactions before computing its hash. The normalized transaction hashes are then used during the signature creation and signature verification of dependent transactions.\n+\n+== Motivation ==\n+\n+Transaction malleability refers to the fact that transactions can be modified, either by one of the signers by re-signing the transaction or a third-party by modifying the signature representation. This is a problem since any modification to the serialized representation also changes the hash of the transaction, which is used by spending transaction to reference the funds that are being transferred. If a transaction is modified and later confirmed by ending up in the blockchain all transactions that depended on the original transaction are no longer valid, and thus orphaned.\n+\n+BIPs 62<ref>[[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0062.mediawiki|BIP 62 - Dealing with malleability]]</ref> and 66<ref>[[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0066.mediawiki|BIP 66 - Strict DER signatures]]</ref> alleviate the problem of third-party modification by defining a canonical representation of the signatures. However, the checking the canonical representation is complex and may not eliminate all sources of third-party malleability. Furthermore, these BIPs do not address modifications by one of the signers, i.e., re-signing the transaction, because signers can produce any number of signatures due to the random parameter in ECDSA.\n+\n+This proposal eliminates malleability altogether by removing the malleable signatures from the hash used to reference the outputs spent by a transaction. The new hash used to reference an output is called the ''normalized transaction ID''. The integrity of all data that is used to reference the output is guaranteed by the signature itself, and any modification that would change the normalized transaction ID would also invalidate the signature itself.\n+\n+Besides eliminating transaction malleability as a source of problems it also allows the use of transaction templates. Transaction templates simplify higher level protocols and allows new uses. They allow an unsigned template transaction to be used as a basis for a sequence of transaction and only once the sequence matches the signers' expectations they provide the necessary signatures for the template to become valid, thus opting in to the sequence.\n+\n+== Specification ==\n+\n+The use of normalized transaction IDs is introduced as a softfork. The specification is divided into three parts:\n+\n+ - Computation of the normalized transaction ID\n+ - Introduction of a new extensible signature verification opcode to enable softfork deployment\n+ - Changes to the UTXO tracking to enable normalized transaction ID lookup\n+\n+=== Normalized Transaction ID computation ===\n+\n+In order to calculate the normalized transaction ID, the signature script is stripped from each input of the transaction of non-coinbase transactions. Stripping the signature script is achieved by setting the script's length to 0 and removing the <code>uchar[]</code> array from the <code>TxIn</code>.<ref>[[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_Specification#tx|Protocol Specification: TX]]</ref>\n+The normalized transaction ID is then computed as the <code>SHA 256</code> hash of the stripped transaction matching the existing transaction ID computation. The normalized transaction ID remains unchanged even if the signatures of the transaction are replaced/malleated and describe a class of semantically identical transactions. In the following we use ''transaction instance ID'' to refer to the transaction ID computed on the transaction including signatures. Normalized transaction IDs for coinbase transactions are computed with the signature script in the coinbase input, in order to avoid hash collisions.\n+\n+=== OP_CHECKSIGEX ===\n+This BIP introduces a new opcode <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> which replaces <code>OP_NOP4</code>. <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> subsumes <code>OP_CHECKSIG(VERIFY)</code> and <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIG(VERIFY)</code> and extends their semantics by allowing additional parameters.\n+\n+When executed <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> pops an integer from the top of the stack. This integer encodes the binary options which determine how <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> verifies signatures. The following table shows the possible flags at the time of writing:\n+\n+{| class=\"wikitable\"\n+!colspan=\"6\"|OP_CHECKSIGEX flags\n+|-\n+! Name\n+! Value\n+!

Refer to the developer documentation<ref>[[https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#p2pkh-script-validation|Developer Documentation - P2PKH Script Validation]]</ref> for their semantics.\n+\n+The existing <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIG</code> and <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY</code> have a bug<ref>[[https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#multisig|Developer Documentation - Multisig]]</ref> that pops one argument too many from the stack. This bug is not reproduced in the implementation of OP_CHECKSIGEX, so the canonical solution of pushing a dummy value onto the stack is not necessary.\n+\n+<code>SCRIPT_CHECKSIGEX_NORMALIZE</code> indicates that before computing the signaturehash, i.e., the hash that is signed, the transaction should be normalized by replacing all transaction IDs in the inputs by their normalized variants. The normalized transction IDs are computed as described in the next section. This normalization step is performed both when creating the signatures as well as when checking the signatures.\n+\n+In order to make use of the normalization feature, this BIP introduces two new standard transaction types\n+\n+    OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubkey hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_4 OP_CHECKSIGEX\n+\n+and \n+\n+    <num sigs> <pubkeys> <numpubkeys> OP_6 OP_CHECKSIGEX\n+\n+The first is the equivalent of the pay-to-pubkeyhash script with normalization (<code>OP_4 = SCRIPT_CHECKSIGEX_NORMALIZE</code>), while the second is the equivalent of the pay-to-multisig also with normalization (<code>OP_6 = SCRIPT_CHECKSIGEX_NORMALIZE | SCRIPT_CHECKSIGEX_MULTI</code>). The format of the <code>scriptSig</code> corresponds to the original version, with exception of omitting the dummy <code>OP_0</code> in the multisig case.\n+\n+=== Tracking Normalized Transaction IDs ===\n+\n+The transaction version is bumped to 2. The new version signals to clients receiving the transaction that they should track the normalized transaction ID along with the transaction instance ID in the unspent transaction output (UTXO) set. Upon receiving a version 2 transaction the client computes the normalized transaction ID, annotates the outputs with it, and adds them into the UTXO set indexed by the transaction instance ID as before. Transactions continue using the transaction instance ID to reference the outputs, but while checking the signature they may get normalized. All network messages continue to use the transaction instance ID to reference the transaction, specifically <code>inv</code>, <code>getdata</code>, <code>tx</code> and <code>block</code> messages still use transaction instance IDs, not the normalized transaction IDs.\n+\n+Outputs created by version 1 transactions are not annotated with the normalized transaction ID, and when normalizing the hashes in transaction inputs referencing version 1 outputs are not modified.\n+\n+== Rationale ==\n+\n+Normalized transaction IDs are provably non-malleable since no data is included in the signaturehash whose integrity is not also proven in the signature, thus any modification causing the hash to change will also invalidate the signature.\n+Normalized transactions are secure as they still use cryptographic hashes over all the semantic information of the transaction, i.e., the inputs, outputs and metadata, thus it is still computationally infeasible to cause a hash collision between transactions.\n+\n+There are a number of advantages to using normalized transaction IDs:\n+\n+* Like BIP 62 and BIP 66 it solves the problem of third-parties picking transactions out of the network, modifying them and reinjecting them, as was allegedly done to defraud MtGox<ref>[[http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/7e4a7f3f2991784786037285f4876f5c/malleability.pdf|Bitcoin Transaction Malleability and MtGox]]</ref>.",

The transaction ID is normalized by removing the signature scripts from transactions before computing its hash. The normalized transaction hashes are then used during the signature creation and signature verification of dependent transactions.\n+\n+== Motivation ==\n+\n+Transaction malleability refers to the fact that transactions can be modified, either by one of the signers by re-signing the transaction or a third-party by modifying the signature representation. This is a problem since any modification to the serialized representation also changes the hash of the transaction, which is used by spending transaction to reference the funds that are being transferred. If a transaction is modified and later confirmed by ending up in the blockchain all transactions that depended on the original transaction are no longer valid, and thus orphaned.\n+\n+BIPs 62<ref>[[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0062.mediawiki|BIP 62 - Dealing with malleability]]</ref> and 66<ref>[[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0066.mediawiki|BIP 66 - Strict DER signatures]]</ref> alleviate the problem of third-party modification by defining a canonical representation of the signatures. However, the checking the canonical representation is complex and may not eliminate all sources of third-party malleability. Furthermore, these BIPs do not address modifications by one of the signers, i.e., re-signing the transaction, because signers can produce any number of signatures due to the random parameter in ECDSA.\n+\n+This proposal eliminates malleability altogether by removing the malleable signatures from the hash used to reference the outputs spent by a transaction. The new hash used to reference an output is called the ''normalized transaction ID''. The integrity of all data that is used to reference the output is guaranteed by the signature itself, and any modification that would change the normalized transaction ID would also invalidate the signature itself.\n+\n+Besides eliminating transaction malleability as a source of problems it also allows the use of transaction templates. Transaction templates simplify higher level protocols and allows new uses. They allow an unsigned template transaction to be used as a basis for a sequence of transaction and only once the sequence matches the signers' expectations they provide the necessary signatures for the template to become valid, thus opting in to the sequence.\n+\n+== Specification ==\n+\n+The use of normalized transaction IDs is introduced as a softfork. The specification is divided into three parts:\n+\n+ - Computation of the normalized transaction ID\n+ - Introduction of a new extensible signature verification opcode to enable softfork deployment\n+ - Changes to the UTXO tracking to enable normalized transaction ID lookup\n+\n+=== Normalized Transaction ID computation ===\n+\n+In order to calculate the normalized transaction ID, the signature script is stripped from each input of the transaction of non-coinbase transactions. Stripping the signature script is achieved by setting the script's length to 0 and removing the <code>uchar[]</code> array from the <code>TxIn</code>.<ref>[[https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_Specification#tx|Protocol Specification: TX]]</ref>\n+The normalized transaction ID is then computed as the <code>SHA 256</code> hash of the stripped transaction matching the existing transaction ID computation. The normalized transaction ID remains unchanged even if the signatures of the transaction are replaced/malleated and describe a class of semantically identical transactions. In the following we use ''transaction instance ID'' to refer to the transaction ID computed on the transaction including signatures. Normalized transaction IDs for coinbase transactions are computed with the signature script in the coinbase input, in order to avoid hash collisions.\n+\n+=== OP_CHECKSIGEX ===\n+This BIP introduces a new opcode <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> which replaces <code>OP_NOP4</code>. <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> subsumes <code>OP_CHECKSIG(VERIFY)</code> and <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIG(VERIFY)</code> and extends their semantics by allowing additional parameters.\n+\n+When executed <code>OP_CHECKSIGEX</code> pops an integer from the top of the stack.
