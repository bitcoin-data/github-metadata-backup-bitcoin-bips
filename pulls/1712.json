It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. A shepherds may perform the role of an Author for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. A shepherds may perform the role of an Author for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP.

It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made.

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. A shepherds may perform the role of an Author for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned.

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. A shepherds may perform the role of an Author for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements",
