However the number assigners were unresponsive to the proposal in the past, and the current implementation is very well recognized by the BIP100 label, with 7% of blocks referencing it along with independent web sites.\r\n",

It's the job of the author to properly format and submit it as a PR. @jgarzik dropped the ball on that, not us.\r\n\r\nIt is my opinion that this current draft is sufficiently equivalent to be the same BIP, but that is based on my technical reading of the two, *not* a post-hoc justification for any perceived neglect or whatever.\r\n\r\nAlso, on what basis do you say the popular BIP100 references are in fact referring to this version of the draft, rather than the original one? Seems to me it is more likely the latter, since these references began long before this draft existed...",

      "body": "@ftrader That's not true, there was a formal write up [here](https://github.com/jgarzik/bip100/blob/b2b6fe99b5934bc55588bfa1ce7588f5fef61286/discussion.md#a-concrete-proposal--bip-100) way back in 2015, it just hadn't been submitted to the BIP repo back then. It's quite clear that this altering of the original BIP100 proposal is an attempt to hijack the original support BIP100 had back in 2015 for a very different proposal. The BIP process is designed to document concrete proposals so that they can be vetted by the community, substantially changing the BIP halfway through this process makes it much more difficult to measure community support since it is no longer clear which proposal a company is supporting if they say they support \"BIP100\".",

Larger blocks allow more growth in the on-chain ecosystem, while smaller blocks reduce resource requirements network-wide.  Miners also act as an efficient proxy for the rest of the ecosystem, since they are paid in the tokens collected for the blocks they create.\n+\n+A simple deterministic system is specified, whereby a 75% mining supermajority may activate a change to the maximum block size each 2016 blocks.  Each change is limited to a 5% increase from the previous block size hard limit, or a decrease of similar magnitude.  Among adopting nodes, there will be no disagreement on the evolution of the maximum block size.\n+\n+The system is compatible with emergent consensus, but whereas under that system a miner may choose to accept any size block, a miner following BIP100 observes the 75% supermajority rule, and the 5% change limit rule.

Example: a complete coinbase string might read <br /><br /><code>/BIP100/B8/EB2.123456/</code><br /><br /> which indicates a vote for 8M maximum block size, and an enforced <code>hardLimit</code> of 2.123456 megabytes for the block containing the coinbase string.\n+\n+==Deployment==\n+\n+This BIP is presumed deployed and activated as of block height 449568 by implementing nodes on the bitcoin mainnet. It has no effect until a raise value different from 1M is observed, which requires at least 1512 of 2016 blocks to vote differently from 1M.\n+\n+==Backward compatibility==\n+\n+The first block larger than 1M will create a network partition, as nodes with a fixed 1M hard limit reject that block.\n+\n+==Reference Implementation==\n+https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/pull/188",

Example: a complete coinbase string might read <br /><br /><code>/BIP100/B8/EB2.123456/</code><br /><br /> which indicates a vote for 8M maximum block size, and an enforced <code>hardLimit</code> of 2.123456 megabytes for the block containing the coinbase string.\n+\n+==Deployment==\n+\n+This BIP is presumed deployed and activated as of block height 449568 by implementing nodes on the bitcoin mainnet. It has no effect until a raise value different from 1M is observed, which requires at least 1512 of 2016 blocks to vote differently from 1M.",
