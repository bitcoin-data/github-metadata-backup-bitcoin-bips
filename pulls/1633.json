This means a client would need to request ''33 bytes * 3500'' of data per block (roughly 100 kB per block). If a client were to request data for every block, this would amount to ~450 MB per month, assuming 100% taproot usage and all non-dust outputs remain unspent for > 1 month. As of today, these numbers are closer to 2–10 kB per block (30–50 MB per month)<ref name=\"appendix_data\">''' Data for Appendix A ''' These numbers are based on data from January 2023 until July 2024.
