However, even before this is merged to the repo it would be helpful for me to have a BIP number assigned, so that I can continue work on the implementation and having that reviewed, and not be held up for the trivial fact that there is no BIP number.\r\n\r\n```\r\n562 2021-02-04T21:59:49  <sipa> sdaftuar, luke-jr: the second paragraph of sdaftuar's ML post about it (https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-January/018340.html) is probably a good start\r\n563 2021-02-04T22:00:39  <luke-jr> ah\r\n564 2021-02-04T22:01:07  <luke-jr> so the point is to allow N*M light connections where being unsure means only N could be accepted?\r\n565 2021-02-04T22:01:24  <luke-jr> (though IIRC our limits are due to FD set sizes and open fd limits currently?)\r\n566 2021-02-04T22:03:56  <sipa> luke-jr: my understanding is this: we have a default inbound connection limit (125) which is based on the observation that every \"fully fledged\" connection has a significant impact on processing costs and bandwidth (among other things), so we can't just raise that without impacting worst-case performance of average nodes\r\n569 2021-02-04T22:04:58  <sipa> if we instead knew for block-only connections (on the incoming side) that they'd *never* need transactions, the worst part is reduced, and perhaps it becomes acceptable to have more incoming connections per peer, given that some percentage of them are reserved for non-block-relaying connections\r\n570 2021-02-04T22:05:19  <sipa> right now, the block-only nature of a connection is only known on the outbound side\r\n571 2021-02-04T22:05:21  <luke-jr> I see\r\n```",

Additionally, addr messages\n+received from the peer are ignored by this software.\n+\n+The purpose of these connections is two-fold: by making additional\n+low-bandwidth connections on which blocks can propagate, the robustness of a\n+node to network partitioning attacks is strengthened.  Additionally, by not\n+relaying transactions and ignoring received addresses, the ability of an\n+adversary to learn the complete network graph (or a subgraph) is reduced[2],\n+which in turn increases the cost or difficulty to an attacker seeking to carry\n+out a network partitioning attack (when compared with having such knowledge).\n+\n+The low-bandwidth / minimal-resource nature of these connections is currently\n+known only by the initiator of the connection; this is because the transaction\n+relay field in the version message is not a permanent setting for the lifetime\n+of the connection.  Consequently, a node receiving an inbound connection with\n+transaction relay disabled cannot distinguish between a peer that will never\n+enable transaction relay (as described in BIP 37) and one that will.  Moreover,\n+the node also cannot determine that the incoming connection will ignore relayed\n+addresses; with that knowledge a node would likely choose other peers to\n+receive announced addresses instead.\n+\n+This proposal adds a new, optional message that a node can send a peer when\n+initiating a connection to that peer, to indicate that connection should not be\n+used for transaction relay for the connection's lifetime. In addition, without\n+a current mechanism to negotiate whether addresses should be relayed on a\n+connection, this BIP suggests that address messages not be sent on links where\n+transaction relay has been disabled.\n+\n+After this BIP is deployed, nodes could more easily implement inbound\n+connection limiting that differentiates low-resource nodes (such as those\n+sending disabletx) from full-relay peers, potentially allowing for an increase\n+in the number of block-relay-only connections that can be made on the network.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+# A new disabletx message is added, which is defined as an empty message where pchCommand == \"disabletx\".\n+# The protocol version of nodes implementing this BIP must be set to 70017 or higher.\n+# If a node sets the transaction relay field in the version message to a peer to false, then the disabletx message MAY also be sent in response to a version message from that peer if the peer's protocol version is >= 70017.
