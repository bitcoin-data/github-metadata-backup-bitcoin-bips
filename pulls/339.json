    "body": "Follow-up from #315\n\nThe following BIPs appear to meet the criteria for Final status, but have not been promoted to Accepted by their author yet, so theoretically need ACKs from the authors. Since @genjix is MIA, and @mikehearn ignores Bitcoin, we need to discuss how to handle such actions when BIP champions disappear - BIP 1 allows for me to assign an additional champion to take over, but I'm not sure anyone would necessarily want to do so in these cases.\n\nBIP 60: BIP 37 was apparently not clear on whether the new \"relay transactions\" flag was mandatory or optional. BIP 60 sought to explicitly make it mandatory. In parallel, Jeff Garzik interpreted BIP 37's field as mandatory in bitcoin/bitcoin#2534 and Pieter Wuille implemented the changes required for that (and BIP 60) in bitcoin/bitcoin#2763 . Numerous forks of Bitcoin Core since then have also picked up this change.\n\nBIP 64: The getutxo message was implemented for use between (pre-contentious hardforks) Bitcoin XT and Lighthouse. Both of these are unmaintained now, but this does not seem relevant.\n",

BIP 60 sought to explicitly make it mandatory. In parallel, Jeff Garzik interpreted BIP 37's field as mandatory in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/2534 and Pieter Wuille implemented the changes required for that (and BIP 60) in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2763 . Numerous forks of Bitcoin Core since then have also picked up this change.\n\nBIP 64: The getutxo message was implemented for use between (pre-contentious hardforks) Bitcoin XT and Lighthouse. Both of these are unmaintained now, but this does not seem relevant.\n\nBIP 66: Softfork accepted by a supermajority of miners.\n\nBIP 73: Implemented by at least Bitcoin Core and BitPay.",

      "body": "It's worth noting that the change to version.relay behavior in the satoshi client spanned release and protocol versions. And as you say, this difference was also picked up by forks. From libbitcoin comments:\r\n```\r\n    // The /Satoshi:0.8.x/ node (70001) reads (but does not send) relay byte.\r\n    // The /Satoshi:0.9.x/ node (70002) sends (and reads) the relay byte.\r\n```\r\nIn order to not fail a high number of connections it's necessary to allow peers reporting 70001 to not set the byte. Failing connections above 70001 results in a very small number of dropped connections, such as the following:\r\n```cpp\r\n// \"/Satoshi:1.1.1/\" (70006) no relay\r\n//     anarchistprime: bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1001407\r\n//     This node is identifiable by a different genesis block.\r\n// \"/Cornell-Falcon-Network:0.1.0/\" (70014) no relay\r\n// \"/therealbitcoin.org:0.9.99.99/\" (99999) no relay\r\n```\r\nSo it seems that the BIP60 treatment of relay as optional in 70001 and mandatory in 70002 is reasonably consistent on the network. Variations are likely forks of version 70001 or prior that failed to track protocol changes.",
