      "body": "I’m not convinced this PR is an improvement.\r\n\r\nBoth BIP 2 and BIP 3 emphatically recommend that people discuss their idea in public **before** spending time on a fully fleshed out proposal. Obviously, this is especially true for would-be authors that are new to protocol development. \r\n\r\nThe first step should be to discuss your idea among friends and collaborators to test and hone an idea. If it survives the local cracker-barrel discussion and comes out even better, it’s probably still a good idea to get more feedback from a broader circle on social media or some more experienced people. After that, a **summary of your idea** should be put to discussion on the mailing list.\r\n\r\nIf you skip testing your idea and jump right to writing a full proposal, while new at this, you are likely to overlook significant flaws in the approach and spend a lot of time on something that is unlikely to see much traction.\r\n\r\nIf your idea gets no support on the mailing list, or doesn’t even make the mailing list, I would suggest trying to make up the skipped steps, not to skip ahead to open a PR here.",

Or is the mailing list still considered the only acceptable path for an idea to be recognized as worth discussing?\r\n\r\nI’m asking because if the list blocks a substantive proposal, but the broader community engages with it elsewhere, it seems important to understand whether that external engagement is considered meaningful or simply disregarded.\r\n\r\nThe goal isn’t to burden moderators or force publication of junk. It’s to avoid a situation where moderation decisions—intentional or not—determine which technical proposals are allowed to enter public discussion. Ideas need some visible path to review that doesn’t depend on mailing list approval. [The-Cat](https://github.com/ostromcode/The-Cat/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#process-note-mailing-list-moderation) is a great example of this. ",
