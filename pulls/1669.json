There wasn't any response on mailing list but I have discussed it with some developers and there seems to be lot of interest for the idea among users.\r\n\r\nThis is an initial draft and the pull request will help me complete the BIP ASAP. \r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Add rationale section\r\n- [x] Add proof of concept\r\n- [x] Add acknowledgment section\r\n- [ ] Add more technical details\r\n",

Ideally, these UTXOs should be ones that have been swapped with others and are linked to someone else’s transaction history.\n+\n+'''Input Obfuscation with Off-Chain Swaps'''\n+\n+Do off-chain swaps (e.g. statechain, submarine swaps, or coinswap) to obtain UTXOs with different histories. Ensure that all inputs come from other users except one belonging to the sender, making it difficult for on-chain analysts to determine ownership.\n+\n+'''Silent Payment Address for Outputs'''\n+\n+Use silent payment addresses to generate new addresses for the recipient.\n+\n+'''Multiple Outputs and Different Interpretations'''\n+\n+The transaction includes multiple outputs, which may include change to the sender, hiding the payment amount.\n+\n+An algorithm requiring some values from the user to create the transaction or notify the user about missing inputs will be implemented by different wallets:\n+\n+* Payment amount\n+* Number of inputs (default: 3)\n+* Number of outputs (default: 2)\n+* Equal amounts in inputs (default: false)\n+\n+Analysis of different decoy selection algorithms used in Monero: https://github.com/monero-project/research-lab/issues/99\n+\n+Input selection is important in Octojoin, although not the same as decoy selection used in different Monero wallets. Recommendations for Octojoin algorithms:\n+\n+Transaction MUST have at least 3 inputs, all swapped except one. It SHOULD avoid mixed input types and use random wallet fingerprints, including BIP 69. It SHOULD use inputs of similar age. Some inputs SHOULD be recent UTXOs. All outputs MUST use the same script type.\n+\n+==Implementation==\n+\n+Pseudocode: https://uncensoredtech.substack.com/p/octojoin\n+\n+Proof of Concept: TBD\n+\n+==Backwards Compatibility==\n+\n+This is a new protocol and has no compatibility issues. It is not a replacement for payjoin either and benefits from multiple interpretations on-chain.",

Submarine swaps are easily identifiable via an on-chain HTLC construction and also include a multisig construction.\r\n- A coinswap is a payment received to the recipient whose inputs were not controlled by the sender.\r\n\r\nGiven that two of the listed examples exhibit uncommon patterns, and the third constitutes a payment to a wallet that was executed by a different UTXO owner than the sender, it’s not clear to me how a transaction funded by a combination of such inputs would have significantly improved privacy properties. If an observer simply categorizes the inputs and analyses their pedigree under the corresponding context, it seems likely that a transaction would be sufficiently recognizable as an Octojoin and given the small number of Statechain and Submarine Swap providers, potentially even identifiable via information requests to such service providers.
