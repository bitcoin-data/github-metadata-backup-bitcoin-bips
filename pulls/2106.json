    "body": "As previously announced in the [libsecp256k1 `silentpayments` module discussion](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1799#issuecomment-3842046237) and on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/tgcAQVqvzVg) ~2 weeks ago, this PR introduces a `K_max` limit to BIP-352 to mitigate worst-case scanning time for adversarial transactions. So far [no objections have been raised](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1799#issuecomment-3891774608) against that protocol change, which is backwards-incompatible in theory.\r\n\r\nThe Python reference implementation is adapted and test vectors for the following two scenarios are added:\r\n* Sending fails if any recipient group (i.e. recipients that share the same scan public key) exceeds the limit\r\n* Scanning only detects outputs with k values up to K_max (exclusive, i.e. from k=0..999), even if more would be available \r\n\r\nCan be tested by running `$ ./bip-0352/reference.py ./bip-0352/send_and_receive_test_vectors.json`. The test vectors pass the tests in the [libsecp256k1 module](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1765) as well, see commit https://github.com/theStack/secp256k1/commit/7ae84f8971ce36ab5cb9a7af30c436dd42d34ea2. [1] \r\n\r\nNote that the value K_max=1000 is somewhat arbitrary and can still be debated, it's simply one that came up relatively early in the discussion and is believed to be fine even for very unusual scenarios like \"exchange sends to another exchange\"  (see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1799#issuecomment-3773155788). An alternative number that was brought up later was K_max=2324, as this is the theoretical maximum for standard-sized (i.e. <= 100_000 kvB) transactions (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1799#issuecomment-3789112995). Personally I think even a lower limit than K_max=1000 would be fine, like something in the \"lower hundreds\" range, but with 1000 we are still comfortably in the \"seconds\" range for the worst-case on a reasonably modern machine. See benchmark results https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1765#issuecomment-3862265628 for more details.\r\n\r\nAnother suggested BIP change is introducing a [warning about wallet interoperability](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1765#issuecomment-3910051227) w.r.t. the number of labels created. As I see this as an orthogonal change, I will open a separate PR for this. One slightly related PR is https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/2087, which would standardize the EC parts of the reference code and make it look a bit nicer. It's not strictly necessary, but I'm happy to rebase this PR if #2087 gets in first.\r\n\r\n[1] I haven't included this commit in the secp PR yet as it's unclear to me if we want to bloat the repository with >120k new LOC and several mega-bytes of additional test data, considering a test case for this already exists. Something to be discussed further in https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/1765.",

Wouldn’t it be better to just limit silent payment transactions to 1000 outputs? It’s not like that would make Silent Payment transactions stick out like a sore thumb. ;)",

      "body": "> I guess I misunderstood so far what kind of limit you were looking to impose. I thought that Silent Payment transactions would generally be limited to 1000 outputs.\r\n\r\nLimiting the total number of transaction outputs for Silent Payments eligibility might be a possible alternative, but it seems to be more restrictive in terms of composability. There is currently no rule that in a Silent Payments transaction all (taproot) outputs have to be Silent Payments related, users are free to combine it with an arbitrary number of non-Silent-Payments outputs. Considering this, can we be sure that a total tx output limit would never cause unintended problems in any wallet flow? It could e.g. happen that a user first creates exactly N_max [1] outputs with a Silent Payments library, and then some collaborative protocol adds another unrelated taproot output on top, without necessarily being aware that the already existing outputs even have a Silent Payments context (they just look like random taproot outputs). In that scenario the Silent Payments recipients wouldn't get paid, as the resulting transaction isn't considered Silent Payments eligible, due to having N_max+1 outputs and thus exceeding the limit. (Slightly related: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/2055#discussion_r2692907049).\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm not too familiar with concrete collaboration protocols and flows, so the scenario I painted might also be a bit far-fetched, especially since it must be a single entity having control over all the inputs private keys (as otherwise it couldn't have created the Silent Payments outputs in the first place). When thinking about simpler solutions, one obvious idea would be to limit the size of Silent Payments eligible transactions to 100 kvB. No matter what protocols are in use, it seems at least very unlikely to me that any of them would at the end not respect the current policy limit and create a tx that would likely not be relayed and need out-of-band miner communication. On the other hand, no policy limit is set in stone, so in some sense even that would potentially restrict flexibility for the future. :man_shrugging:\r\nI remember having discussed this with @RubenSomsen a while ago, who likely has more convincing arguments for K_max.\r\n\r\n[1] using the N_max notion for your \"limit total outputs\" proposal to differentiate it from the K_max one",

      "body": "Hi everyone, sorry I just caught up on this. \r\n\r\nFirst, I concept ACK a limit on _k_.\r\n\r\nBut as I said when we first talked about this on a call a couple months ago I consider this a rather theoretical problem since afaiu the incentives for the supposed attacker are just not there at all, i.e. attacker will spend a lot of money just to slow down transaction scanning for the victim. Even worse, he's actually paying the victim a significant amount. I wish I could be attacked like this more often :)\r\n\r\nMore seriously I agree on a reasonable restriction to prevent worst cases. Limiting _k_ to 1000 seems reasonable to me, that's a number of outputs for the same recipient we're very unlikely to ever hit in practice and it gives us a clear upper bound of how long scanning can take. That doesn't interfere with policy like other proposals, that's purely a cap on a silent payment parameter, and it can be easily bypassed/reversed later if needed, even if I doubt we'll ever need to.",

I agree that it's a very unusual attack with relatively weak incentives, probably even calling it \"attack\" in the first place seems a bit exaggerated. Note though that the recipient doesn't necessarily get paid, as there is currently nothing in the protocol mandating a minimum output amount. An attacker could include e.g. one large non-Silent-Payments output as change to themselves, and all the other Silent-Payments outputs that match for the recipient have 0 sats (being below the dust limit, that's non-standard, but still consensus valid). Silent Payments wallets would still want to scan such a transaction, considering that the single high-amount output _could_ be a match.",

      "body": "@murchandamus raises a good point that ~23 users can be targeted simultaneously every 10 minutes, rather than one (or e.g., at k=500, ~46). This mainly makes it cheaper for an attacker because it only requires 1/23rd of a full block worth of fees per victim.\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't think this is a major concern. Limiting k is mainly making it computationally feasible for an individual user to deal with being targeted regardless of the whims of the block space market. Furthermore, it remains the case that for a targeted attack to occur (regardless whether 1 or 23 people are targeted), it requires outbidding everyone else for the entire block.\r\n\r\nIf we're looking at the effect on the total set of users, during a targeted attack the combined scanning burden actually goes down. A block with a single targeted worst-case transaction is ~5x cheaper to scan for non-targeted people (expensive EC mults are only done per TX, so fewer TXs = faster). The most effective way to maximize the combined scanning burden is not with a targeted attack, but by filling the block with 1-input 1-output taproot transactions.\r\n\r\nThe reasons why we'd prefer limiting K has already been mentioned, but my generalized take is that we want to minimize the number of constraints we put on SP transactions to ensure no incompatibilities occur with other protocols (including future ones).\r\n\r\nAnd for those unaware, @theStack was [appointed co-author of BIP352](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/issues/1799#issuecomment-3773155788), so his voice carries no less weight than my own.",
