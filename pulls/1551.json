This BIP defines a protocol to do so using only the DNS, providing for the ability to query such resolutions privately, while utilizing DNSSEC to provide compact and simple to verify proofs of mappings.\r\n\r\nI'd like to hereby request a BIP number assignment. What is the current approach to do so - since the mailing list has died, is a post on delving bitcoin the appropriate place to publish BIP drafts?",

Using DNSSEC, the DNS provides cryptographic guarantees using a straightforward PKI which follows the hierarchical nature of the DNS, allowing for stateless and even offline validation of DNS records from a single trusted root.\n+\n+Further, because DNS queries are generally proxied through ISP-provided or other resolvers, DNS queries usually do not directly expose the queryer's IP address. Further, because of the prevalence of open resolvers, the simplicity of the protocol, and broad availability of DNS recursive resolver implementations, finding a proxy for DNS records is trivial.\n+\n+Thus, using TXT records to store Bitcoin payment instructions allows for human-readable Bitcoin payment destinations which can be trivially verified on hardware wallets and which can be resolved relatively privately.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+=== General rules for handling ===\n+Bitcoin wallets MUST NOT prefer to use DNS-based resolving when methods with explicit public keys are available. In other words, if a standard Bitcoin address or direct BIP 21 URI is available or would suffice, Bitcoin wallets MUST prefer to use that instead.\n+\n+=== Records ===\n+Payment instructions are indexed by both a user and a domain. Instructions for a given `user` and `domain` are stored at `user`.user._bitcoin-payment.`domain` in a single TXT record.\n+\n+All payment instructions MUST be DNSSEC-signed.\n+\n+Payment instructions MAY resolve through CNAME or DNAME records as long as all relevant records are DNSSEC signed.\n+\n+User and domain names which are not expressible using standard printable ASCII MUST be encoded using the punycode IDN encoding defined in [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3492|RFC 3492]] and [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5891|RFC 5891]].\n+\n+=== Resolution ===\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST ignore any TXT records at the same label which do not begin with (ignoring case) \"bitcoin:\". Resolvers encountering multiple \"bitcoin:\"-matching TXT records at the same label MUST treat the records as invalid and refuse to use any payment instructions therein.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST fully validate DNSSEC signatures leading to the DNS root (including any relevant CNAME or DNAME records) and MUST NOT accept DNSSEC signatures which use SHA-1 or RSA with keys shorter than 1024 bits. Resolvers MAY accept SHA-1 DS records.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST NOT trust a remote resolver to validate DNSSEC records on their behalf.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST support resolving through CNAME or DNAME records.\n+\n+Resolvers MAY support resolving non-ASCII user and domain identifiers. Resolvers which do support non-ASCII user and domain identifiers MUST take precautions to prevent homograph attacks and SHOULD consider denying paste functionality when entering non-ASCII identifiers.\n+\n+=== Address Reuse ===\n+Payment instructions with on-chain addresses SHOULD be rotated as regularly as possible to reduce address reuse. In cases where this is not practical, payment instructions SHOULD NOT contain on-chain addresses (i.e. the URI path SHOULD be empty).\n+\n+== Rationale ==\n+\n+There are many existing schemes to resolve human-readable names to cryptocurrency payment instructions. Sadly, these current schemes suffer from a myriad of drawbacks, including (a) lacking succinct proofs of namespace to public key mappings, (b) revealing sender IP addresses to recipients or other intermediaries as a side-effect of payment, (c) relying on the bloated TLS Certificate Authority infrastructure, or (d) lacking open access, not allowing anyone to create a namespace mapping.\n+\n+=== DNS Rather than blockchain-based solutions ===\n+There are many blockchain-based alternatives to the DNS which feature better censorship-resistance and, in many cases, security. However, here we chose to use the standard ICANN-managed DNS namespace as many blockchain-based schemes suffer from (a), above (though in some cases this could be addressed with cryptographic SNARK schemes). Further, because they do not have simple client-side querying ability, many of these schemes use trusted intermediaries which resolve names on behalf of clients. This reintroduces drawbacks (b) and often (c) as well.\n+\n+Finally, its worth noting that none of the blockchain-based alternatives to the DNS have had material adoption outside of their specific silos, and committing Bitcoin wallets to rely on a separate system which doesn't see broad adoption may not be sustainable.\n+\n+=== DNS Rather than HTTP-based solutions ===\n+HTTP(s)-based payment instruction resolution protocols suffer from drawbacks (a), (b), and (c), above, and generally shouldn't be considered a serious alternative for payment instruction resolution.\n+\n+=== Private DNS Querying ===\n+While public recursive DNS resolvers are very common (e.g. 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8, and 9.9.9.9), using such resolvers directly (even after validating DNSSEC signatures) introduces drawback (b), at least in regard to a centralized intermediary. Resolving payment instructions recursively locally would instead introduce drawback (b) directly to the recipient, which may well be worse.\n+\n+For payers not using VPN or other proxying technologies, they generally trust their ISP for protection against denial of service anyway, so using ISP-provided recursive DNS resolvers is sufficient.\n+\n+However, for the best privacy, payers are encouraged to perform DNS resolution over Tor or another VPN technology.\n+\n+Lightning payers should consider utilizing DNS resolution over native onion messages, using the protocol described in [[BLIP 32|https://github.com/lightning/blips/blob/master/blip-0032.md]]\n+\n+== Examples ==\n+\n+`matt@mattcorallo.com` resolves to\n+`matt.user._bitcoin-payment.mattcorallo.com. 3600 IN TXT\t\"bitcoin:?b12=lno1qsgqmqvgm96frzdg8m0gc6nzeqffvzsqzrxqy32afmr3jn9ggkwg3egfwch2hy0l6jut6vfd8vpsc3h89l6u3dm4q2d6nuamav3w27xvdmv3lpgklhg7l5teypqz9l53hj7zvuaenh34xqsz2sa967yzqkylfu9xtcd5ymcmfp32h083e805y7jfd236w9afhavqqvl8uyma7x77yun4ehe9pnhu2gekjguexmxpqjcr2j822xr7q34p078gzslf9wpwz5y57alxu99s0z2ql0kfqvwhzycqq45ehh58xnfpuek80hw6spvwrvttjrrq9pphh0dpydh06qqspp5uq4gpyt6n9mwexde44qv7lstzzq60nr40ff38u27un6y53aypmx0p4qruk2tf9mjwqlhxak4znvna5y\"`",
