      "body": "I don't think PSBT is the right way to be doing this. Descriptors are not necessary in PSBT, and relaxing the invariant that a PSBT represents a transaction (by allowing a PSBT to include no transaction data) would break many parsers and also just is antithetical to PSBT. It's not a general purpose format for sending data around - you could use protobuf if you wanted that.\r\n\r\nIf the goal is to have a machine parsable representation of descriptors, then by all means, do that. But it doesn't need to (nor do I think it should) interact with PSBT, other than having a different header that identifies it.\r\n\r\nIt's also unnecessary to have a descriptor in a PSBT. A PSBT can contain all of the data to derive it from the scriptPubKey at a later time. If an updater has the descriptor in order to put it in the PSBT, then it can also put the rest of the data in the PSBT so that the descriptor can be inferred. I just don't see how this proposal is at all useful.\r\n\r\nAlso, descriptors are a textual format, and encoding text in binary is just not very efficient. There are better ways to do that if you really wanted to.",
