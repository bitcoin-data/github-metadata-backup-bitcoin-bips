      "body": "Hello,\n\nWow a lot of questions. \n\nLet me try to go over some justifications. \n\nFirst thing to note about korean language is that it is an agglutinative one. Which means that ~~hada is, even though there's an repetitive postfix, a complete lexem. The configuration is usually 2~3 symbols + a postfix to define its part of speech. That's for the case of verbs, adverbs, and adjectives mostly. \n\nOn the other hand, nouns tend to be shorter because they do not  contain trailing affixes. They are short usually in 2~3 symbols range. \n\nIf one confines the selection of words to nouns and word roots, variety of word length becomes rather limited. However, there are also cases where ~~hada and ~~ alone are both legitimate words. \n\nHence I removed all the cases in the frequently used dictionary that are in multiple forms. For example if there are zzz+hada and zzz, I removed both of them to avoid confusion. \n\nWhen summarized:\n1. To strengthen variety of word length, I opted for mixing verbs, nouns, adverbs, and adjectives. \n2. After all the filtering I ended up with, out of ~5000 words, ~3000 words. Which I believe is a proper set to randomly pick 2048 words from. \n3. Repetition of hada hani and etc is intrinsic to Korean language. Every verb in its basic form ends ~~hada basically. For your pun and information, the ~~hada becomes ~~haetda for past tense, ~~haeseo for because of doing ~~, et cetra and et cetra.\n4. For typical length of words in korean language I decided to make to first 2 symbols distinct. Considering that the characters are already composition of multiple syllables. For example, 닭 which means chicken is a composition of ㄷ(d) ㅏ(a) ㄹ(r) ㄱ(g), and it reads as darg. Hence, entropy wise one composed character in korean language is roughly equivalent to 2~4 symbols in roman characters. Converting back, by taking 2 unique characters in korean language, I am taking on the average 4~6 unique symbols in roman alphabets. That should agree well with the standard published in bip 39. \n\nHowever, I concur with your concern that structured repetition of hada might have undesirable impact on randomizing the seed. From what I know little, it should not affect the quality of the final seed because the mnemonic goes through many rounds of hashing, and hashing is all about distributing bits here and there. But well, I might as well be very wrong at the same time. \n\n\n\n나의 iPhone에서 보냄\n\n2017. 6. 1. 오전 9:00 Dabura667 <notifications@github.com> 작성:\n\n> Also, there's a lot of ~hada words, which I understand is similar to ~suru in Japanese.

This should be decided to do all as one or the other, and not mix. Since many words can be used with -hada, I suggest making the rule to NOT use -hada verbs.\r\n\r\nUsing words that have meaning in Korean is not enough for this wordlist, the word selection should have some common sense applied for the use case.\r\nThis list currently needs a lot of work.\r\nA lot of words are not appropriate for the recovery phrase.\r\nI think the Japanese word list uses common sense rules that could be used in a similar way for Korean.",
