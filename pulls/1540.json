Since nonces must not be reused, this PR holds them exclusively in memory, so a restart of the software will require a restart of the MuSig2 signing process. Additionally, the current MuSig API in libsecp basically involves us holding onto and passing around an opaque libsecp object. There may be some additional work there to make the code more ergonomic.",

Since BIP 327 suggests to do sorting, we decided it made sense to do in descriptors as well.\r\n\r\nBIP 327 discusses the possibility of sorting and describes a canonical sorting, but I didn't read it as 'suggesting' one way or another.\r\n\r\nIn general, I'd prefer maximum simplicity and less chances of malleability in descriptors, and this imho goes against both (albeit slightly, not a huge deal).\r\n\r\nNote that this removes functionality, as one of $n! - 1$ of the $n!$ possible combinations become inexpressible with descriptors.",

However, as the best practice is to use a new address for every payment,\n+it is necessary for the cosigners of a single aggregate pubkey to have a way to produce additional\n+aggregate pubkeys.\n+\n+The obvious method is for the cosigners to generate multiple public keys and produce a\n+new aggregate pubkey every time one is needed. This is similar to how multisig using Bitcoin script\n+works where all of the cosigners share their extended public keys and do derivation to produce\n+the multisig script. The same could be done with MuSig2 and instead of producing a multisig script,\n+the result would be a MuSig2 aggregate pubkey.\n+\n+However, it is much simpler to be able to derive from a single extended public key instead of having\n+to derive from many extended public keys and aggregate them. As MuSig2 produces a normal looking\n+public key, the aggregate public can be used in this way. This reduces the storage and computation\n+requirements for generating new aggregate pubkeys.",

However, as the best practice is to use a new address for every payment,\n+it is necessary for the cosigners of a single aggregate pubkey to have a way to produce additional\n+aggregate pubkeys.\n+\n+The obvious method is for the cosigners to generate multiple public keys and produce a\n+new aggregate pubkey every time one is needed. This is similar to how multisig using Bitcoin script\n+works where all of the cosigners share their extended public keys and do derivation to produce\n+the multisig script. The same could be done with MuSig2 and instead of producing a multisig script,\n+the result would be a MuSig2 aggregate pubkey.\n+\n+However, it is much simpler to be able to derive from a single extended public key instead of having\n+to derive from many extended public keys and aggregate them. As MuSig2 produces a normal looking\n+public key, the aggregate public can be used in this way. This reduces the storage and computation\n+requirements for generating new aggregate pubkeys.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+A synthetic xpub can be created from a BIP 327 MuSig2 plain aggregate public key by setting\n+the depth to 0, the child number to 0, and attaching a chaincode with the byte string\n+<tt>868087ca02a6f974c4598924c36b57762d32cb45717167e300622c7167e38965</tt><ref>'''Where does this\n+constant chaincode come from?'''

However, as the best practice is to use a new address for every payment,\n+it is necessary for the cosigners of a single aggregate pubkey to have a way to produce additional\n+aggregate pubkeys.\n+\n+The obvious method is for the cosigners to generate multiple public keys and produce a\n+new aggregate pubkey every time one is needed. This is similar to how multisig using Bitcoin script\n+works where all of the cosigners share their extended public keys and do derivation to produce\n+the multisig script. The same could be done with MuSig2 and instead of producing a multisig script,\n+the result would be a MuSig2 aggregate pubkey.\n+\n+However, it is much simpler to be able to derive from a single extended public key instead of having\n+to derive from many extended public keys and aggregate them. As MuSig2 produces a normal looking\n+public key, the aggregate public can be used in this way. This reduces the storage and computation\n+requirements for generating new aggregate pubkeys.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+A synthetic xpub can be created from a BIP 327 MuSig2 plain aggregate public key by setting\n+the depth to 0, the child number to 0, and attaching a chaincode with the byte string\n+<tt>868087ca02a6f974c4598924c36b57762d32cb45717167e300622c7167e38965</tt><ref>'''Where does this\n+constant chaincode come from?'''

It is useful to have a way for keys to be used\n+in a MuSig2 aggregate key to be expressed in descriptors so that wallets can more easily use MuSig2.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+A new key expression is defined: <tt>musig()</tt>.\n+\n+===<tt>musig()</tt>===\n+\n+The <tt>musig(KEY, KEY, ..., KEY)</tt> expression can only be used inside of a <tt>tr()</tt>\n+expression as a key expression. The aggregate public key is produced by using the <tt>KeyAgg</tt>\n+algorithm on all KEYs specified in the expression after performing all specified derivation. As with\n+script expressions, KEY can contain child derivation specified by <tt>/*</tt>. A new aggregate\n+public key will be computed for each child index.
