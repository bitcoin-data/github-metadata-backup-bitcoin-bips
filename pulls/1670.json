(For more on why, see the Rationale and Security sections.) A constraint is that no hard fork or increase in block size are necessary. This document is inspired by [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki BIP-341], which introduced the design of the P2TR (Taproot) address type using Schnorr signatures.\n+\n+\n+=== Copyright ===\n+\n+This document is licensed under the 3-clause BSD license.\n+\n+\n+=== Motivation ===\n+\n+This proposal aims to improve the quantum resistance of bitcoin's signature security should the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) which secures Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) no longer prove to be computationally hard, likely through quantum advantage by Cryptographically-Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs). [https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0301141 A variant of Shor's algorithm] is believed to be capable of deriving the private key from a public key exponentially faster than classical means. The application of this variant of Shor's algorithm is herein referred to as quantum key decryption. Note that doubling the public key length, such as with a hypothetical secp512k1 curve, would only make deriving the private key twice as hard. The computational complexity of this is investigated further in the paper, [https://pubs.aip.org/avs/aqs/article/4/1/013801/2835275/The-impact-of-hardware-specifications-on-reaching ''The impact of hardware specifications on reaching quantum advantage in the fault tolerant regime''].\n+\n+Mining may one day be vulnerable to disruption by very advanced quantum computers making use of Grover's algorithm. However, Grover's [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.02332 scales very poorly] compared to Shor's, requiring 10^40 quantum operations in comparison to 10^8 for running Shor's over ECC. It's for this reason that the primary threat to Bitcoin by quantum computers is to its signature algorithm and not Proof of Work, hence the focus on a new address format.\n+\n+The vulnerability of existing bitcoin addresses is investigated in [https://web.archive.org/web/20240715101040/https://www2.deloitte.com/nl/nl/pages/innovatie/artikelen/quantum-computers-and-the-bitcoin-blockchain.html this Deloitte report]. The report estimates that in 2020 approximately 25% of the bitcoin supply is held within addresses vulnerable to quantum attack.\n+\n+Ordinarily, when a transaction is signed, the public key can be recovered from the signature. This makes a transaction submitted to the mempool vulnerable to quantum attack until it's mined. One way to mitigate this is to submit the transaction directly to a mining pool, which bypasses the mempool. This process is known as an out-of-band transaction. The mining pool must be trusted not to reveal the key to attackers.\n+\n+It is proposed to implement a Pay to Quantum Resistant Hash (P2QRH) address type that relies on a post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) signature algorithm. This new address type protects transactions submitted to the mempool and helps preserve the free market by reducing the need for private, out-of-band mempool transactions.\n+\n+The following table is non-exhaustive, but meant to inform the average bitcoin user whether their bitcoin is vulnerable to quantum attack.\n+\n+{|\n+|+ Vulnerable address types\n+|-\n+!

The report estimates that in 2020 approximately 25% of the bitcoin supply is held within addresses vulnerable to quantum attack.\n+\n+Ordinarily, when a transaction is signed, the public key can be recovered from the signature. This makes a transaction submitted to the mempool vulnerable to quantum attack until it's mined. One way to mitigate this is to submit the transaction directly to a mining pool, which bypasses the mempool. This process is known as an out-of-band transaction. The mining pool must be trusted not to reveal the key to attackers.",
