      "body": "In addition to the test vector updates, I made some updates, in a second commit, regarding casing requirements.\r\nHere's my rationale for these additional changes:\r\n\r\nEncoding:\r\nHRP should always be lowercased. This is because:\r\n1) From the existing BIP: \"The lowercase form is used when determining a character's value for checksum purposes.\"\r\n2) Encoders should always output a non-mixed case Bech32 string. Lowercase is canonical due the previous item, and the fact that the encoding charset is all lowercase. Otherwise, the HRP would need to be scanned to make sure it is consistent case and then upper/lower case according to that finding.\r\n\r\nFor presentation, or QR code use, a simple uppercasing can be run externally on the encoding result.\r\nThis is consistent with the \"A12UEL5L\" test vector currently in the BIP, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> segwit_addr.bech32_encode('a', []).upper()\r\n'A12UEL5L'\r\n```\r\n\r\nDecoding:\r\nBecause of the BIP requirement that, \"The lowercase form is used when determining a character's value for checksum purposes.\":\r\n1) Decoding treats uppercase and lowercase inputs as equal. The hrp still needs to be lowercased before hrp expansion during checksum calculation.\r\n2) The transcription problems associated with mixed-case are avoided without restriction on acceptance of mixed-case input for decoding.\r\n3) Not accepting mixed-case input for decoding is seemingly punitive.\r\n\r\nTangentially related: https://github.com/sipa/bech32/issues/25",

I think we should definitely use UTF-8 instead of US-ASCII. \r\n\r\nI've added a commit and will squash it upon approval.\r\n\r\nDoing this will avoid the unmappable character issue and make using this easier for many people using higher level languages that use unicode strings. UTF-8 is compatible with ASCII because the mapping for ASCII uncompatible code points goes to multibyte, with each byte being out of ASCII range (which we'll already reject). This is easy to see in the table at the top of the description at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> '\\U00000080'.encode('utf-8')\r\nb'\\xc2\\x80'\r\n>>> '\\U00000800'.encode('utf-8')\r\nb'\\xe0\\xa0\\x80'\r\n>>> '\\U00010000'.encode('utf-8')\r\nb'\\xf0\\x90\\x80\\x80'\r\n```",

You could say Unicode code points (or Unicode characters), though.\n\nI think it's unnecessary though. The text does not say \"The HRP must consist of Unicode characters, converted to US-ASCII\" - that would be prone to having character conversion issues. It says \"must consist of ASCII characters\". If you're using it with other characters, regardless of how you encoding them, it's already used incorrectly.",

You could say Unicode code points (or Unicode characters), though.\r\n\r\nAgree, good catch.\r\n\r\nThe reason I bring this up is because of languages like Java (but not just Java) where the String type is UTF-16. So, that's what a user of the library is going to have and then it's going to be sent in and the library is going to have to encode to what Bech32 needs.\r\nFor example:\r\nhttps://github.com/mruddy/bech32/blob/master/src/com/github/mruddy/bip173/bech32/Bech32.java#L150-L152\r\nIf Bech32 needs UTF-8, then there is no mapping issue. If Bech32 needs US-ASCII, then there can be problems introduced or exceptions generated. Otherwise the library user needs to know to convert to UTF-8 and then pass in a byte array, instead of the native String type, or do a code point check before sending the String in. Since we have the 7-bit restriction, this is safe. I think it makes the BIP more developer friendly.",

Because of the existing requirement to use the lowercase form to determine a character's value for checksum purposes, there is no difference between upper and lower case characters in any position of the bech32 string. That applies to the HRP because it is also used to compute the checksum. So, on a micro level, I don't see a reason why a decoder should fail the input. On a macro level, I can see where you might be trying to discourage mixed case. But, the other changes I made also push in that direction (in fact fixing this: `segwit_addr.bech32_encode('A', [])`).",

      "body": "I read the BIP contrary to that. My interpretation was that no such requirement that the HRP is non-empty is in the BIP. The BIP even says that the HRP's validity is application specific (which builds on top of generic Bech32). That's why this works:\r\n```\r\n>>> segwit_addr.bech32_create_checksum('', [])\r\n[15, 29, 15, 26, 11, 7]\r\n>>> segwit_addr.bech32_verify_checksum('', [] + [15, 29, 15, 26, 11, 7])\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\nIt seems odd that we'd encode something that can't be decoded. I think the reference decoder is implementing a phantom requirement right now. If we add a requirement that HRP be non-empty, I think that's OK, just other things need to be updated also. Am I making sense?",
