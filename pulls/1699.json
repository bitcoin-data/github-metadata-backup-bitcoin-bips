We were talking about computing a merkle tree for `f(u32,u32)` as if it was trivial but after a quick experiment it seems like that would take hundreds of years to compute (am I being dumb here?) Instead, you can compute `mul(u32,u32) -> u32` using 3 `mul(u16,u16)`s which *is* feasible to compute. The witness size is worse, ~`32 * 32 * 3 = 3072` instead of `32 * 64 * 1 = 2048`, but computing the tree for `mul(u16,u16)` is feasible using a naive algorithm on commodity hardware.\r\n\r\nThe implication of this is that where a function can be decomposed into operations on smaller inputs, PAIRCOMMIT is massively more feasible to use than encoding things into a tap tree.",

      "body": "> I think I've changed my mind a bit. We were talking about computing a merkle tree for `f(u32,u32)` as if it was trivial but after a quick experiment it seems like that would take hundreds of years to compute (am I being dumb here?) Instead, you can compute `mul(u32,u32) -> u32` using 3 `mul(u16,u16)`s which _is_ feasible to compute. The witness size is worse, ~`32 * 32 * 3 = 3072` instead of `32 * 64 * 1 = 2048`, but computing the tree for `mul(u16,u16)` is feasible using a naive algorithm on commodity hardware.\r\n\r\nArithmetic and bitwise operations where inputs & outputs are small enough, can already be done in Script in cheaper ways. Merkle trees as lookup tables are only interesting for functions that are either extremely complex, or where preimages/images are larger than what Script can work with.\r\nNote that you can already do small indexed lookup tables more efficiently by just hard-coding them in Script (that is: push the table on the stack and use OP_PICK to read its entries), and these techniques are widely used (e.g. in BitVM).\r\n\r\n> The implication of this is that where a function can be decomposed into operations on smaller inputs, PAIRCOMMIT is massively more feasible to use than encoding things into a tap tree.\r\n\r\nI think the only substantial difference is that in a Script where you need several lookups, you can do it with Merkle trees, while you can only do a single lookup with a precomputed taptree.",

Merkle trees as lookup tables are only interesting for functions that are either extremely complex, or where preimages/images are larger than what Script can work with. Note that you can already do small indexed lookup tables more efficiently by just hard-coding them in Script (that is: push the table on the stack and use OP_PICK to read its entries), and these techniques are widely used (e.g. in BitVM).\r\n\r\nEven u16,u16 is quite a bit larger than I think is practical as a lookup table, but the efficiency for repeated operations is constant, obviously. The lookup table is less efficient for small numbers of operations (a u8,u8 table is 16k vs 1 u8,u8 proof is 0.4k) but the merkle tree loses quickly when those operations are repeated.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> > The implication of this is that where a function can be decomposed into operations on smaller inputs, PAIRCOMMIT is massively more feasible to use than encoding things into a tap tree.\r\n> \r\n> I think the only substantial difference is that in a Script where you need several lookups, you can do it with Merkle trees, while you can only do a single lookup with a precomputed taptree.\r\n\r\nRight, and the key point is these merkle trees and lookup tables rapidly become infeasible to compute as the input size grows, so multiple smaller lookups is significantly more useful.\r\n\r\nEDIT: But your point is well taken that for smaller operations they can already be better accomplished by lookup tables.",

After a bit of conversation on IRC it could probably be feasible for arbitrary `f(b[4],b[4]) -> b[8]` with a custom ASIC¹ or maybe a cluster of FPGAs in a span of ~a few years but that would not be very useful for the average person.\r\n\r\nBit shifts over 32 bit integers seems pretty feasible though, that's `f(u32,u6)->u32` (maybe save some space by special casing shift = 0). it seems like my incredibly naive, unoptimized, single-core experiment could calculate that merkle tree in ~96 hours. Of course the proof is ~1.2k and users would likely need multiple, but the lookup table for that wouldn't fit in a block anyway so maybe something new is possible?\r\n\r\nYou can also separate positive and negative shifts, and maybe break it down into multiple rounds of shifts 1-3 or something (or 1k for a proof for a constant shift)\r\n\r\n[1]: afaik existing ASICs operate on block headers so couldn't help",

Bigint and new arithmetic operations would\r\nbe hard or even impossible.\r\n\r\n* Merkle operation opcodes\r\n\r\nThese would be of very limited general use and hard to rationalize without\r\nOP_CAT. Their complexity and resource cost is hard to justified for vector\r\ncommitments only. Compatibility considerations with taproot MAST were also\r\nhard to resolve without knowing what other opcodes may be activated in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n* 'Kitty' CAT (result or inputs limited in size)\r\n\r\nThe original idea would have limited the maximum size of `OP_CAT` output to a\r\nsize that is smaller than the smallest sighash preimage, thus disabling the\r\nintrospection capabilities and trivial ways to extend the arithmetic repertoir\r\nof bitcoin script. This turned out to be an awkward, arbitrary and offering\r\nweak .\r\n\r\n* OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY commiting to the taproot annex in tapscript\r\n\r\nA CTV template can be considered a sighash, however relaxing the relay policy\r\nto take advantage of this change would make various endogenous asset protocols\r\nmore efficient, and therefore be controversial. There is also no consensus on\r\nhow to use or how to structure the annex.\r\n\r\n* OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK on n elements as message\r\n\r\nThis was previosuly discussed and also implemented, it complicates the code\r\nand is a pretty arbitrary coupling of behaviors.\r\n\r\n* OP_VECTORCOMMIT\r\n\r\nThe obvious generalized solution for committing to n stack elements, however\r\nit involves looping and hard to argue about setting the proper limits to it.\r\n",

They together provide the core utility. `IKEY` is an optimization for not having to pay for the pubkey twice when the internal key can be used. `PC` is an optimization when `CSFS` has to commit to additional data required to recreate a spend script from an intermediate state, because `OP_RETURN` (to which `CTV` naturally commits to) is 4x more expensive in weight units for data availability.\r\n\r\n`PC` could also be used by `CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY` to carry a complex state in the absence of `CAT`.\r\n\r\nI don't think anyone would find `PC` useful enough to activate in isolation without the aforementioned other opcodes.\r\nIt can do general merkle tree style commitments that are not compatible with other merkle tree structures in bitcoin.\r\n\r\nWe probably will make a new BIP for LNhance that has these other BIPs as \"Relies on\".",
