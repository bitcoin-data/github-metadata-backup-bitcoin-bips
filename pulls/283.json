If we use the BIP142 scheme, the problem is that when a new segwit will release, no wallet will be able to send to it... all wallets want to do is sending money, they should not need to implement a new address scheme for a new segwit version.\n\nThere should be one address version for both wsh and wpkh.\n",

It is believed that the proposed P2WPKH and P2WSH address format is the easiest way for wallets and services to adopt native witness program, which is particularly important in the context of scaling the capacity of the blockchain.\n \n-The P2PKH segwit addresses only allow simple payment to a single public key. For arbitrarily complex segwit transactions, the general segwit address is used. The use of z-base-32 eliminates case-sensitiveness and simplifies transformation to and from hexadecimals. The Damm algorithm checksum allows detection of all single-digit errors and all adjacent transposition errors. With the excellent upgradability of witness program, this proposal is also forward compatible to new version witness programs that is not longer than 32 bytes.\n+While P2WPKH address is specific for simple payment to a signle public key, P2WSH address allows arbitrarily complex segwit transactions, resemble to the BIP13 P2SH address.",

This is the final address with 69 digits.\n-\n \n == Rationale ==\n \n-The segregated witness soft fork (BIP x) defines 2 ways of encoding \"witness program\", a data push of 2 to 32 bytes:\n+The BIP141 defines 2 ways of encoding \"witness program\", a data push of 2 to 32 bytes:\n \n * A native witness program output is a scriptPubKey with a push of version byte followed by a push of witness program, and nothing else;\n-* A witness program in P2SH is a P2SH redeemScript with a push of version byte followed by a push of witness program, while the scriptPubKey looks like a normal P2SH output.\n+* Segwit-in-P2SH is a BIP16 P2SH redeemScript with a push of version byte followed by a push of witness program, while the scriptPubKey looks like a normal P2SH output.\n \n-As the P2SH address has been defined in 2012, using witness program in P2SH allows most existing wallets to pay a segwit-compatible wallet without any upgrade. However, this method requires more block space and is less collision-resistance than a native witness program, and is only a short-term solution to make the transition smoother. Eventually, all users are expected to use the more efficient native witness program as the primary payment method.\n+As the BIP13 P2SH address has been defined in 2012, using segwit-in-P2SH allows most existing wallets to pay a segwit-compatible wallet without any upgrade. However, this method requires more block space and is only a short-term solution to make the transition smoother. Eventually, all users are expected to use the more efficient native witness program as the primary payment method.\n \n The drawbacks of Bitcoin addresses have been extensively discussed in BIP13. Since then, better payment methods have been proposed or deployed, for example:\n *BIP47 Reusable Payment Codes for Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets\n *BIP63 Stealth Addresses\n *BIP70 Payment protocol\n \n-However, none of these are as widely adopted as the suboptimal base-58 scriptPubKey template addresses, which is still a standard for the whole eco-system, from wallets, block explorers, merchants, exchanges, to end users. As P2PKH transactions are still dominating the blockchain, the author believes that the proposed P2PKH segwit addresses is the easiest way for wallets and services to adopt native witness program, which is particularly important in the context of scaling the capacity of the blockchain.\n+However, none of these are as widely adopted as the suboptimal base-58 scriptPubKey template addresses, which is still a standard for the whole eco-system, from wallets, block explorers, merchants, exchanges, to end users. It is believed that the proposed P2WPKH and P2WSH address format is the easiest way for wallets and services to adopt native witness program, which is particularly important in the context of scaling the capacity of the blockchain.\n \n-The P2PKH segwit addresses only allow simple payment to a single public key. For arbitrarily complex segwit transactions, the general segwit address is used. The use of z-base-32 eliminates case-sensitiveness and simplifies transformation to and from hexadecimals. The Damm algorithm checksum allows detection of all single-digit errors and all adjacent transposition errors. With the excellent upgradability of witness program, this proposal is also forward compatible to new version witness programs that is not longer than 32 bytes.\n+While P2WPKH address is specific for simple payment to a signle public key, P2WSH address allows arbitrarily complex segwit transactions, resemble to the BIP13 P2SH address.",
