      "body": "> I am a little surprised at this pull request, given the [frequent coverage](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/consensus-cleanup-soft-fork/) of Antoine’s [ongoing research](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/great-consensus-cleanup-revival/710/5) on reviving the Great Consensus Cleanup that includes a similar fix. It seems better to me to package all four fixes in one soft fork. Was it overlooked that this work is being duplicated, or are you disagreeing with the direction of Antoine’s work and want to put forward an alternative? Could you elaborate why you decided to submit this?\r\n\r\nHI Murch! \r\n\r\n>Great Consensus Cleanup\r\n\r\nWhile the GCC is a great name for a disjoint set of bitcoin protocol security fixes, that doesn't mean they all need to be bundled into one BIP and deployed at the same time.\r\n\r\n>It seems better to me to package all four fixes in one soft fork.\r\n\r\nThis document takes no opinion on how this enhancement is deployed.\r\n\r\nPreviously we have deployed multiple consensus changes in a single soft fork that contained multiple BIPs. The 2017 Segwit soft fork had [BIP141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki), [BIP143](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki). The Taproot soft fork had [BIP341](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki) and [BIP342](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki).\r\n\r\n>Was it overlooked that this work is being duplicated, \r\n\r\nI was recommended that this was a piece of work that was easily to peel off from the rest of GCC and propose a fix for. Its relatively simple and straight forward, and has been known about for a long time.\r\n\r\n> Antoine's on going research.\r\n\r\nI think Antoine's research is great, but just because he is researching the topic doesn't mean he gets to monopolize the vulnerabilities. The 64 byte transaction vulnerability has been known since at least 2012 - yet no one has taken the time to write up a BIP to fix it 😬 . I've put forth the first BIP draft in the 13 years since this vulnerability has been known. I encourage Antoine to write up his proposal (hopefully sooner rather than later) as he doesn't seem to be interested in working with me. \r\n\r\nOther vulnerabilities in GCC have also been known about for a long time - such as worse case block validation time. Antoine has done a lot of novel research there and I think his work product has been excellent on delving. \r\n\r\nThere is plenty of meat left on the GCC bone, this was a small piece I decided to carve off.",

Peers that receive the invalid block before the valid block\n+will never come to consensus with their peers due to the malicious user finding a collision\n+within the block's merkle root.

This in turn allows for proving to a Bitcoin light client that a\n+given transaction is in a given block by providing a path through the tree to the\n+transaction. However, Bitcoin’s particular construction of the Merkle tree has\n+several security weaknesses, including at least two forms of block malleability\n+that have an impact on the consensus logic of Bitcoin Core, and an attack on\n+light clients, where an invalid transaction could be ”proven” to appear in a block\n+by doing substantially less work than a SHA256 hash collision would require.\n+This has been prevented by relay policy since 2018<ref>[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11423/commits/7485488e907e236133a016ba7064c89bf9ab6da3 PR #11423 disallows 64 byte transactions in bitcoin core relay]</ref>\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+This BIP disallows bitcoin transactions that are serialized to 64 bytes in length without it's witness.\n+\n+==Rationale==",
