Bigint and new arithmetic operations would\r\nbe hard or even impossible.\r\n\r\n* Merkle operation opcodes\r\n\r\nThese would be of very limited general use and hard to rationalize without\r\nOP_CAT. Their complexity and resource cost is hard to justified for vector\r\ncommitments only. Compatibility considerations with taproot MAST were also\r\nhard to resolve without knowing what other opcodes may be activated in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n* 'Kitty' CAT (result or inputs limited in size)\r\n\r\nThe original idea would have limited the maximum size of `OP_CAT` output to a\r\nsize that is smaller than the smallest sighash preimage, thus disabling the\r\nintrospection capabilities and trivial ways to extend the arithmetic repertoir\r\nof bitcoin script. This turned out to be an awkward, arbitrary and offering\r\nweak .\r\n\r\n* OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY commiting to the taproot annex in tapscript\r\n\r\nA CTV template can be considered a sighash, however relaxing the relay policy\r\nto take advantage of this change would make various endogenous asset protocols\r\nmore efficient, and therefore be controversial. There is also no consensus on\r\nhow to use or how to structure the annex.\r\n\r\n* OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK on n elements as message\r\n\r\nThis was previosuly discussed and also implemented, it complicates the code\r\nand is a pretty arbitrary coupling of behaviors.\r\n\r\n* OP_VECTORCOMMIT\r\n\r\nThe obvious generalized solution for committing to n stack elements, however\r\nit involves looping and hard to argue about setting the proper limits to it.\r\n",
