This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. A shepherds may perform the role of an Author for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP.

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. A shepherds may perform the role of an Author for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency.

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. A shepherds may perform the role of an Author for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned.

The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders",

Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits.

Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up to\n+the relevant project directly.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors what issues may arise in its progression. After some investigation,",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate.

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up to\n+the relevant project directly.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors what issues may arise in its progression. After some investigation,\n+the novelty of an idea can be tested by posting about it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). Prior correspondence can be found in the [mailing list\n+archive](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/).\n+\n+Vetting an idea publicly before investing the time to formally describe the idea is meant to save both the authors and",

The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community.

A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency.

For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/).

See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added.

If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits.

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up to\n+the relevant project directly.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors what issues may arise in its progression. After some investigation,\n+the novelty of an idea can be tested by posting about it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). Prior correspondence can be found in the [mailing list\n+archive](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/).\n+\n+Vetting an idea publicly before investing the time to formally describe the idea is meant to save both the authors and\n+the broader community time. Not only may someone point out relevant discussion topics that were missed in the authorsâ€™\n+research, or that an idea is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions, but describing an idea publicly also\n+tests whether it is of interest to more people besides the authors. After establishing that the idea may be of interest\n+to the bitcoin community, the authors should work on drafting a BIP.",

The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up to\n+the relevant project directly.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors what issues may arise in its progression. After some investigation,\n+the novelty of an idea can be tested by posting about it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). Prior correspondence can be found in the [mailing list\n+archive](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/).\n+\n+Vetting an idea publicly before investing the time to formally describe the idea is meant to save both the authors and\n+the broader community time. Not only may someone point out relevant discussion topics that were missed in the authorsâ€™\n+research, or that an idea is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions, but describing an idea publicly also\n+tests whether it is of interest to more people besides the authors. After establishing that the idea may be of interest\n+to the bitcoin community, the authors should work on drafting a BIP.\n+\n+As a first sketch of the proposal is taking shape, the authors should present it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). This gives the authors a chance to collect initial feedback and address\n+fundamental concerns. If the authors wish to work in public on the proposal at this stage, it is recommended that they\n+open a pull request against one of their forks of the BIP repository instead of the main BIP repository.\n+\n+It is recommended that complicated proposals be split into separate BIPs that each focus on a specific component of the\n+overall proposal.\n+\n+### Progression through BIP Statuses\n+\n+The following sections refer to BIP Status Field values. The BIP Status Field is defined in the Header Preamble\n+specification above.\n+\n+#### Draft\n+\n+After fleshing out the proposal further and ensuring that it is of high quality and properly formatted, the authors\n+should open a pull request to the [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips). The document must adhere to the\n+formatting requirements specified below and should be provided as a file named with a working title of the form\n+\"bip-title.[md|mediawiki]\". The authors must not self-assign a number to their proposal.\n+\n+BIPs that (1) adhere to the formatting requirements, (2) are on-topic, and (3) have materially progressed beyond the\n+ideation phase, e.g. by generating substantial public discussion and commentary from diverse contributors, by\n+independent bitcoin projects working on adopting the proposal, or by the authors working for an extended period toward\n+improving the proposal based on community feedback, will be assigned a number by a BIP editor. The BIP editors should\n+delay number assignment when they perceive a proposal being met with lack of interest: number assignment facilitates the\n+distributed discussion of ideas, but before a proposal garners some interest in the bitcoin community, there is no need\n+to refer to it by a number.\n+\n+Proposals are also not ready for number assignment if they duplicate efforts, disregard formatting rules, are too\n+unfocused or too broad, fail to provide proper motivation, fail to address backwards compatibility where necessary, or\n+fail to specify the feature clearly and comprehensively. Reviewers and BIP editors should provide guidance on how the\n+proposal may be improved to progress toward readiness. Pull requests that are proposing off-topic or unserious ideas or\n+have stopped to make progress may be closed.\n+\n+When the proposal is ready and has been assigned a number, a BIP editor will merge it into the BIP repository. After the\n+BIP has been merged to the repository, its main focus should no longer shift significantly, even while the authors may\n+continue to update the proposal as necessary. Updates to merged documents by the authors should also be submitted as\n+pull requests.\n+\n+#### Complete[^complete]\n+\n+When the authors have concluded all planned work on their proposal, are confident that their BIP represents a net\n+improvement, is clear, comprehensive, has a working reference implementation and test vectors (if applicable), and is\n+ready for adoption by the bitcoin community, they may update the BIPâ€™s status to Complete to indicate that they\n+recommend adoption, implementation, or deployment of the BIP. Where applicable, the authors must ensure that any\n+proposed specification is solid, not unduly complicated, and definitive. Subsequently, the BIPâ€™s content should only be\n+adjusted in minor details, e.g. to improve language, clarify ambiguities, backfill omissions in the specification, add\n+test vectors for edge cases, or address other issues discovered as the BIP is being adopted.\n+\n+A Complete BIP can only move to Deployed or Closed. Any necessary changes to the specification should be minimal and\n+interfere as little as possible with ongoing adoption. If a Complete BIP is found to need substantial functional\n+changes, it may be preferable to move it to Closed[^new-BIP], and to start a new BIP with the changes instead.\n+Otherwise, it could cause confusion as to what being compliant with the BIP means.\n+\n+Complete is the final state for most successful Informational BIPs.\n+\n+#### Deployed\n+\n+A settled[^settled] BIP may be advanced to Deployed upon request by any community member with evidence that the idea\n+described in the BIP is in active use. Such evidence includes for example: at least one project having deployed support\n+for the BIP in mainnet software releases, a soft fork proposalâ€™s activation criteria having been met on the network, or\n+rough consensus for the BIP having been demonstrated.\n+\n+At that point, the BIP should be considered final and any breaking changes to the BIP should be proposed as a new\n+separate BIP.[^new-BIP]\n+\n+##### Process BIPs\n+\n+A Process BIP may change status from Complete to Deployed when it achieves rough consensus on the mailing list. Such a\n+proposal is said to have rough consensus if it has been open to discussion on the development mailing list for at least\n+one month, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it. Addressed or obstructive objections\n+may be ignored/overruled by general agreement that they have been sufficiently addressed, but clear reasoning must be\n+given in such circumstances. Deployed Process BIPs may be modified indefinitely as long as a proposed modification has\n+rough consensus per the same criteria.[^living-documents]\n+\n+#### Closed[^closed]\n+\n+A BIP that is _not in active use_, may be labeled Closed when its authors have stopped working on it, no longer\n+recommend the proposed approach, or no longer pursue adoption of their Complete proposal. The reason for moving the\n+proposal to Closed should be recorded in the Changelog section in the same commit that updates the status.\n+\n+##### Draft â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIP authors may decide on their own to change their BIPâ€™s status from Draft to Closed. If a Draft BIP stops making\n+progress, sees accumulated feedback unaddressed, or otherwise appears stalled for a year, the community may move the BIP\n+to Closed unless the authors assert that they intend to continue work when contacted.\n+\n+##### Complete â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIPs that had attained the Complete status, i.e. that had been recommended for adoption, may be moved to Closed per the\n+authorsâ€™ announcement to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List after not being opposed within four weeks. To successfully\n+oppose the move, at least one of the opposers must volunteer to become the BIPâ€™s author or shepherd for the BIP to\n+remain Complete. A BIP can also be moved to Closed by the community if it has had Complete status for at least one year,\n+there is no evidence of it being in active use, and its authors do not object or fail to respond, unless a new author\n+volunteers within four weeks.\n+\n+##### Deployed â†¦ Closed\n+\n+A BIP may evolve from Deployed to Closed when it is no longer in active use. Any community member may initiate this\n+Status update by announcing it to the mailing list, and proceed if no objections have been raised for four weeks.\n+\n+##### Closed â†¦ Draft\n+\n+The Closed status is generally intended to be a final status for BIPs.\n+\n+If BIP authors decide to make another attempt at a previously Closed BIP, it is generally recommended to create a new\n+proposal. (Obviously, the authors may borrow any amount of inspiration or actual text from any prior BIPs as licensing\n+permits.) The authors should take special care to address the issues that caused the prior attemptâ€™s abandonment. Even\n+if the prior attempt had been assigned a number, the new BIP will generally be assigned a distinct number, unless it is\n+obvious that the new attempt directly continues work on the same idea, in which case it may be reasonable to return the\n+Closed BIP to Draft status.\n+\n+### Changelog\n+\n+To help implementers understand updates to a BIP, any changes after it has reached Complete are tracked with version,",

Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP.

User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up to\n+the relevant project directly.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors what issues may arise in its progression. After some investigation,\n+the novelty of an idea can be tested by posting about it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). Prior correspondence can be found in the [mailing list\n+archive](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/).\n+\n+Vetting an idea publicly before investing the time to formally describe the idea is meant to save both the authors and\n+the broader community time. Not only may someone point out relevant discussion topics that were missed in the authorsâ€™\n+research, or that an idea is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions, but describing an idea publicly also\n+tests whether it is of interest to more people besides the authors. After establishing that the idea may be of interest\n+to the bitcoin community, the authors should work on drafting a BIP.\n+\n+As a first sketch of the proposal is taking shape, the authors should present it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). This gives the authors a chance to collect initial feedback and address\n+fundamental concerns. If the authors wish to work in public on the proposal at this stage, it is recommended that they\n+open a pull request against one of their forks of the BIP repository instead of the main BIP repository.\n+\n+It is recommended that complicated proposals be split into separate BIPs that each focus on a specific component of the\n+overall proposal.\n+\n+### Progression through BIP Statuses\n+\n+The following sections refer to BIP Status Field values. The BIP Status Field is defined in the Header Preamble\n+specification above.\n+\n+#### Draft\n+\n+After fleshing out the proposal further and ensuring that it is of high quality and properly formatted, the authors\n+should open a pull request to the [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips). The document must adhere to the\n+formatting requirements specified below and should be provided as a file named with a working title of the form",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits.

The document must adhere to the\n+formatting requirements specified below and should be provided as a file named with a working title of the form\n+\"bip-title.[md|mediawiki]\". The authors must not self-assign a number to their proposal.\n+\n+BIPs that (1) adhere to the formatting requirements, (2) are on-topic, and (3) have materially progressed beyond the\n+ideation phase, e.g. by generating substantial public discussion and commentary from diverse contributors, by\n+independent bitcoin projects working on adopting the proposal, or by the authors working for an extended period toward\n+improving the proposal based on community feedback, will be assigned a number by a BIP editor. The BIP editors should\n+delay number assignment when they perceive a proposal being met with lack of interest: number assignment facilitates the\n+distributed discussion of ideas, but before a proposal garners some interest in the bitcoin community, there is no need\n+to refer to it by a number.\n+\n+Proposals are also not ready for number assignment if they duplicate efforts, disregard formatting rules, are too\n+unfocused or too broad, fail to provide proper motivation, fail to address backwards compatibility where necessary, or\n+fail to specify the feature clearly and comprehensively. Reviewers and BIP editors should provide guidance on how the\n+proposal may be improved to progress toward readiness. Pull requests that are proposing off-topic or unserious ideas or\n+have stopped to make progress may be closed.",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up to\n+the relevant project directly.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors what issues may arise in its progression. After some investigation,\n+the novelty of an idea can be tested by posting about it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). Prior correspondence can be found in the [mailing list\n+archive](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/).\n+\n+Vetting an idea publicly before investing the time to formally describe the idea is meant to save both the authors and\n+the broader community time. Not only may someone point out relevant discussion topics that were missed in the authorsâ€™\n+research, or that an idea is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions, but describing an idea publicly also\n+tests whether it is of interest to more people besides the authors. After establishing that the idea may be of interest\n+to the bitcoin community, the authors should work on drafting a BIP.\n+\n+As a first sketch of the proposal is taking shape, the authors should present it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). This gives the authors a chance to collect initial feedback and address\n+fundamental concerns. If the authors wish to work in public on the proposal at this stage, it is recommended that they\n+open a pull request against one of their forks of the BIP repository instead of the main BIP repository.\n+\n+It is recommended that complicated proposals be split into separate BIPs that each focus on a specific component of the\n+overall proposal.\n+\n+### Progression through BIP Statuses\n+\n+The following sections refer to BIP Status Field values. The BIP Status Field is defined in the Header Preamble\n+specification above.\n+\n+#### Draft\n+\n+After fleshing out the proposal further and ensuring that it is of high quality and properly formatted, the authors\n+should open a pull request to the [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips). The document must adhere to the\n+formatting requirements specified below and should be provided as a file named with a working title of the form\n+\"bip-title.[md|mediawiki]\". The authors must not self-assign a number to their proposal.\n+\n+BIPs that (1) adhere to the formatting requirements, (2) are on-topic, and (3) have materially progressed beyond the\n+ideation phase, e.g. by generating substantial public discussion and commentary from diverse contributors, by\n+independent bitcoin projects working on adopting the proposal, or by the authors working for an extended period toward\n+improving the proposal based on community feedback, will be assigned a number by a BIP editor. The BIP editors should\n+delay number assignment when they perceive a proposal being met with lack of interest: number assignment facilitates the\n+distributed discussion of ideas, but before a proposal garners some interest in the bitcoin community, there is no need\n+to refer to it by a number.\n+\n+Proposals are also not ready for number assignment if they duplicate efforts, disregard formatting rules, are too\n+unfocused or too broad, fail to provide proper motivation, fail to address backwards compatibility where necessary, or\n+fail to specify the feature clearly and comprehensively. Reviewers and BIP editors should provide guidance on how the\n+proposal may be improved to progress toward readiness. Pull requests that are proposing off-topic or unserious ideas or\n+have stopped to make progress may be closed.\n+\n+When the proposal is ready and has been assigned a number, a BIP editor will merge it into the BIP repository. After the\n+BIP has been merged to the repository, its main focus should no longer shift significantly, even while the authors may\n+continue to update the proposal as necessary. Updates to merged documents by the authors should also be submitted as\n+pull requests.\n+\n+#### Complete[^complete]\n+\n+When the authors have concluded all planned work on their proposal, are confident that their BIP represents a net\n+improvement, is clear, comprehensive, has a working reference implementation and test vectors (if applicable), and is\n+ready for adoption by the bitcoin community, they may update the BIPâ€™s status to Complete to indicate that they\n+recommend adoption, implementation, or deployment of the BIP. Where applicable, the authors must ensure that any\n+proposed specification is solid, not unduly complicated, and definitive. Subsequently, the BIPâ€™s content should only be\n+adjusted in minor details, e.g. to improve language, clarify ambiguities, backfill omissions in the specification, add\n+test vectors for edge cases, or address other issues discovered as the BIP is being adopted.\n+\n+A Complete BIP can only move to Deployed or Closed. Any necessary changes to the specification should be minimal and\n+interfere as little as possible with ongoing adoption. If a Complete BIP is found to need substantial functional\n+changes, it may be preferable to move it to Closed[^new-BIP], and to start a new BIP with the changes instead.\n+Otherwise, it could cause confusion as to what being compliant with the BIP means.\n+\n+Complete is the final state for most successful Informational BIPs.\n+\n+#### Deployed\n+\n+A settled[^settled] BIP may be advanced to Deployed upon request by any community member with evidence that the idea\n+described in the BIP is in active use. Such evidence includes for example: at least one project having deployed support\n+for the BIP in mainnet software releases, a soft fork proposalâ€™s activation criteria having been met on the network, or\n+rough consensus for the BIP having been demonstrated.\n+\n+At that point, the BIP should be considered final and any breaking changes to the BIP should be proposed as a new\n+separate BIP.[^new-BIP]\n+\n+##### Process BIPs\n+\n+A Process BIP may change status from Complete to Deployed when it achieves rough consensus on the mailing list. Such a\n+proposal is said to have rough consensus if it has been open to discussion on the development mailing list for at least\n+one month, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it. Addressed or obstructive objections\n+may be ignored/overruled by general agreement that they have been sufficiently addressed, but clear reasoning must be\n+given in such circumstances. Deployed Process BIPs may be modified indefinitely as long as a proposed modification has\n+rough consensus per the same criteria.[^living-documents]\n+\n+#### Closed[^closed]\n+\n+A BIP that is _not in active use_, may be labeled Closed when its authors have stopped working on it, no longer\n+recommend the proposed approach, or no longer pursue adoption of their Complete proposal. The reason for moving the\n+proposal to Closed should be recorded in the Changelog section in the same commit that updates the status.\n+\n+##### Draft â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIP authors may decide on their own to change their BIPâ€™s status from Draft to Closed. If a Draft BIP stops making\n+progress, sees accumulated feedback unaddressed, or otherwise appears stalled for a year, the community may move the BIP\n+to Closed unless the authors assert that they intend to continue work when contacted.\n+\n+##### Complete â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIPs that had attained the Complete status, i.e. that had been recommended for adoption, may be moved to Closed per the\n+authorsâ€™ announcement to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List after not being opposed within four weeks. To successfully\n+oppose the move, at least one of the opposers must volunteer to become the BIPâ€™s author or shepherd for the BIP to\n+remain Complete. A BIP can also be moved to Closed by the community if it has had Complete status for at least one year,\n+there is no evidence of it being in active use, and its authors do not object or fail to respond, unless a new author\n+volunteers within four weeks.\n+\n+##### Deployed â†¦ Closed\n+\n+A BIP may evolve from Deployed to Closed when it is no longer in active use. Any community member may initiate this\n+Status update by announcing it to the mailing list, and proceed if no objections have been raised for four weeks.\n+\n+##### Closed â†¦ Draft\n+\n+The Closed status is generally intended to be a final status for BIPs.\n+\n+If BIP authors decide to make another attempt at a previously Closed BIP, it is generally recommended to create a new\n+proposal. (Obviously, the authors may borrow any amount of inspiration or actual text from any prior BIPs as licensing\n+permits.) The authors should take special care to address the issues that caused the prior attemptâ€™s abandonment. Even\n+if the prior attempt had been assigned a number, the new BIP will generally be assigned a distinct number, unless it is\n+obvious that the new attempt directly continues work on the same idea, in which case it may be reasonable to return the\n+Closed BIP to Draft status.\n+\n+### Changelog\n+\n+To help implementers understand updates to a BIP, any changes after it has reached Complete are tracked with version,\n+date, and description in a Changelog section. The version number is inspired by semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).\n+The MAJOR version is incremented if changes to the BIPâ€™s Specification are introduced that are incompatible with prior\n+versions (which should be rare after a BIP is Complete, and only happen in well-grounded exceptional cases to a BIP that\n+is Deployed). The MINOR version is incremented whenever the specification of the BIP is changed or extended in a\n+backward-compatible way. The PATCH version is incremented for other changes to the BIP that are noteworthy (bug fixes,\n+test vectors, important clarifications, etc.). The version should start at 1.0.0 with the date the BIP was promoted to\n+Complete. An example of a Changelog section can be seen in\n+[BIPâ€¯352](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0352.mediawiki). After a BIP receives a Changelog, the\n+Preamble must indicate the latest version in the Revision header.\n+\n+### Adoption of proposals\n+\n+The BIP repository does not track the sentiment on proposals and does not track the adoption of BIPs beyond whether they\n+are in active use or not. It is not intended for BIPs to list additional implementations beyond the reference\n+implementation: the BIP repository is not a signpost where to find implementations.[^OtherImplementations] After a BIP\n+is advanced to Complete, it is up to the bitcoin community to evaluate, adopt, ignore, or reject a BIP. Individual\n+bitcoin projects are encouraged to publish a list of BIPs they implement. A good example of this at the time of writing\n+this BIP can be observed in Bitcoin Coreâ€™s [doc/bips.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/bips.md)\n+file.\n+\n+### Transferring BIP Ownership\n+\n+It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of BIPs to new owners. In general, it would be preferable to\n+retain the original authors of the transferred BIP, but that is up to the original authors. A good reason to transfer\n+ownership is because the original authors no longer have the time or interest in updating it or following through with\n+the BIP process, or have fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. are unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason\n+to transfer ownership is because someone doesn't agree with the direction of the BIP. The community tries to build\n+consensus around a BIP, but if that's not possible, rather than fighting over control, the dissenters should supply a\n+competing BIP.\n+\n+If someone is interested in assuming ownership of a BIP, they should send an email asking to take over, addressed to the\n+original authors, the BIPâ€¯Editors, and the Bitcoin Development Mailing List. If the authors do not respond in a timely\n+manner (e.g. two weeks), the BIP editors will make a unilateral decision whether to appoint the applicants as\n+[Shepherds](#authors-and-shepherds) (which may be amended should the original authors make a delayed reappearance).\n+\n+## BIP Licensing\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+Each new BIP must identify at least one acceptable license in its preamble. Licenses must be referenced per their\n+respective [SPDX License identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses). New BIPs may be accepted with the licenses described\n+below.\n+\n+For example, a preamble might include the following License header:\n+\n+    License: CC0-1.0\n+             GNU-All-Permissive\n+\n+In this case, the BIP text is fully licensed under both the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license as well as the\n+GNU All-Permissive License, and anyone may modify and redistribute the text provided they comply with the terms of\n+*either* license. In other words, the license list is an \"OR choice\", not an \"AND also\" requirement.\n+\n+It is also possible to license source code differently from the BIP text by including the optional License-Code header\n+after the License header. Again, each license must be referenced by their respective SPDX License identifier shown\n+below.\n+\n+Each source code file or source directory should specify the license under which it is made available as is common in\n+software (e.g. with a license header or a LICENSE/COPYING file). It is recommended to make any test vectors available\n+under CC0-1.0 or GNU-All-Permissive in addition to any other licenses to allow anyone to copy test vectors into their\n+implementations without introducing license hindrances. Licenses listed in the License-Code header apply to all source\n+directories, source code files, and test vectors provided with the BIP except those where a LICENSE file in a directory\n+or the file header states otherwise.\n+\n+For example, a preamble specifying the optional License-Code header might look like:\n+\n+    License:         CC0-1.0\n+    License-Code:    MIT\n+\n+In this case, the code in the BIP is not available under CC0-1.0, but is only available under the terms of the MIT\n+License.\n+\n+BIPs are not required to be *exclusively* licensed under approved terms, and may also be licensed under unacceptable\n+licenses *in addition to* at least one acceptable license. In this case, only the acceptable license(s) should be listed\n+in the License and License-Code headers.\n+\n+It is recommended that BIPs that include literal code be licensed under the same license terms as the project it\n+modifies. For example, literal code intended for Bitcoin Core would ideally be licensed (or dual-licensed) under the MIT\n+license terms.\n+\n+In all cases, details of the licensing terms must be provided in the Copyright section of the BIP.\n+\n+#### Acceptable licenses[^licenses]\n+\n+* BSD-2-Clause: [OSI-approved BSD 2-clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)\n+* BSD-3-Clause: [OSI-approved BSD 3-clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)\n+* CC0-1.0: [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\n+* GNU-All-Permissive: [GNU All-Permissive License](http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/License-Notices-for-Other-Files.html)\n+* CC-BY-4.0: [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n+* CC-BY-SA-4.0: [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)\n+* MIT: [Expat/MIT/X11 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n+\n+#### Not acceptable licenses\n+\n+All licenses not explicitly included in the above lists are not acceptable terms for a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal.\n+However, BIPs predating the acceptance of this BIP were allowed under other terms, and should use these abbreviations\n+when no other license is granted:\n+\n+* PD: Released into the public domain\n+* OPL: [Open Publication License, version 1.0](http://opencontent.org/openpub/)\n+\n+## BIP Editors\n+\n+The current BIP editors are:\n+\n+* Bryan Bishop ([kanzure@gmail.com](mailto:kanzure@gmail.com))\n+* Jon Atack ([jon@atack.com](mailto:jon@atack.com))\n+* Luke Dashjr ([luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org](mailto:luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org))\n+* Mark \"Murch\" Erhardt ([murch@murch.one](mailto:murch@murch.one))\n+* Olaoluwa Osuntokun ([laolu32@gmail.com](mailto:laolu32@gmail.com))\n+* Ruben Somsen ([rsomsen@gmail.com](mailto:rsomsen@gmail.com))\n+\n+### BIP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow\n+\n+The BIP editors subscribe to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List and watch the [BIPs\n+repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips).\n+\n+When a new BIP idea is submitted to the mailing list, BIP editors and other community members should comment in regard\n+to:\n+\n+* Novelty of the idea\n+* Viability, utility, and relevance of the concept\n+* Readiness of the proposal\n+* On-topic for the bitcoin community\n+\n+Discussion in pull request comments can often be hard to follow as feedback gets marked as resolved when it is addressed\n+by authors. Substantive discussion of ideas may be more accessible to a broader audience on the mailing list, where it\n+is also more likely to be retained by the community memory.\n+\n+If the BIP needs more work, an editor should ensure that constructive, actionable feedback is provided to the authors\n+for revision. Once the BIP is ready it should be submitted as a \"pull request\" to the [BIPs\n+repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) where it may get further feedback.\n+\n+For each new BIP pull request that comes in, an editor checks the following:\n+\n+* The idea has been previously discussed on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List\n+* Title accurately describes the content\n+* Proposal is of general interest and/or pertains to more than one bitcoin project/implementation\n+* Document is properly formatted\n+* Licensing terms are acceptable\n+* Motivation, Rationale, and Backward Compatibility have been addressed\n+* Specification provides sufficient detail for implementation\n+* The defined Layer header must be correctly assigned for the given specification\n+* The BIP is ready: it is comprehensible, technically feasible, and all aspects are addressed as necessary\n+\n+Editors do NOT evaluate whether the proposal is likely to be adopted.\n+\n+A BIP editor will:\n+\n+* Assign a BIP number and BIP type in the pull request\n+* Merge the pull request when it is ready\n+* List the BIP in the [README](README.mediawiki)\n+\n+The BIP editors are intended to fulfill administrative and editorial responsibilities. The BIP editors monitor BIP\n+changes, and update BIP headers as appropriate.\n+\n+BIP editors may also, at their option, unilaterally make and merge strictly editorial changes to BIPs, such as\n+correcting misspellings, fixing broken links, etc. as long as they do not change the meaning or conflict with the\n+original intent of the authors. Such a change must be recorded in the Changelog if itâ€™s noteworthy per the criteria\n+mentioned in the [Changelog](#changelog) section.\n+\n+## Backward Compatibility\n+\n+### Changes from BIPâ€¯2\n+\n+- Introduce Shepherds and optional Shepherds header\n+- Rename \"Author\" field to \"Authors\"\n+- Refer to the proposers of a BIP as \"authors\" throughout the document.\n+- The Standards Track type is superseded by the similar Specification type.[^standard-track]\n+- Most sections are declared optional, it is up to the authors and audience to judge whether all relevant topics have\n+  been comprehensively addressed and which topics require a designated section to do so.\n+- Layer header is optional for Specification BIPs or Informational BIPs, as it does not make sense for all BIPs.[^layer]\n+- The comment system is abolished. Comments-URI and Comment-Summary headers are dropped from the preamble, Comments as\n+  an aspect of the process are discontinued.[^comments]\n+- Process BIPs are living documents that do not ossify and may be modified indefinitely.\n+- Titles may now be up to 50 characters.\n+- The Discussions-To header is dropped as it has never been used in any BIP.\n+- The Post-History header is replaced with the Discussion header.\n+- The Status field is no longer modeled around the workflow of consensus changes.\n+- Status field values are reduced from nine to four:\n+  - Deferred, Obsolete, Rejected, Replaced, and Withdrawn are gathered up into Closed.[^closed]\n+  - Final and Active are collapsed into Deployed.\n+  - The remaining statuses are Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed.\n+- BIPs no longer get rejected solely on grounds of not making progress for three years.[^rejection]\n+- A BIP may be set to Closed by its authors, or by anyone if it appears to have stopped making progress for at least a\n+  year and its authors do not assert that they are still working on it when contacted.\n+- Many judgment calls previously required from BIP Editors are reassigned either to the BIP authors or the repositoryâ€™s\n+  audience.\n+- Tracking of adoption, acceptance, and community consensus is out of scope for the BIP repository, except to determine\n+  whether a BIP is in active use for the move into or out of the Deployed status.\n+- \"Other Implementations\" sections are discouraged.[^OtherImplementations]\n+- Auxiliary files are only permitted in the corresponding BIPâ€™s subdirectory, as no one used the alternative of labeling\n+  them with the BIP number.\n+- The set of acceptable licenses was reduced to the ones previously used, and the distinction between recommended and\n+  acceptable licenses was dropped\n+\n+### Updates to existing BIPs should this BIP be activated\n+\n+#### Previous BIP Process\n+\n+This BIP supersedes BIPâ€¯2 as the guideline for the BIPâ€¯process.\n+\n+#### BIP types\n+\n+Standards Track BIPs and eligible Informational BIPs are assigned the Specification type. The Standards Track type is\n+considered obsolete. Specification BIPs use the Layer header rules specified in [BIPâ€¯123](BIP-0123.mediawiki).\n+\n+#### Comments\n+\n+The Comments-URI and Comment-Summary headers should be removed from all BIPs whose comment page in the wiki is empty.\n+For existing BIPs whose comment page has content, BIP Authors may keep both headers or remove both headers at their\n+discretion. It is recommended that existing wiki pages are not modified due to the activation of this BIP.\n+\n+#### Status field\n+\n+After the activation of this BIP, the Status fields of existing BIPs that do not fit the specification in this BIP are\n+updated to the corresponding values prescribed in this BIP.\n+\n+#### Authors header\n+\n+The Author header is replaced with the Authors header in all BIPs.\n+\n+#### Shepherds header\n+\n+The optional Shepherds header is introduced to distinguish the original authors of a BIP from later successors.\n+\n+#### Discussion header\n+\n+The Post-History header is replaced with the Discussion header in all BIPs.\n+\n+#### Licenses\n+\n+The licenses of existing BIPs remain untouched.\n+\n+## Copyright\n+\n+This BIP is licensed under the [BSD-2-Clause License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause).

Due to Informational\n+    BIPs being described as optional, Standards Track BIPs were sometimes misunderstood to be generally recommended.\n+    This has led to a number of BIPs that propose new features affecting interoperability of implementations being\n+    assigned the Informational type. The situation is remedied by introducing a new _Specification BIP_ type that is\n+    inclusive of any BIPs that can be implemented and affect interoperability of bitcoin applications. Since all BIPs\n+    are individual recommendations by the authors (even if some may eventually achieve endorsement by the majority of\n+    the community), the prior reminder that Informational BIPs are optional is dropped.\n+[^comments]: **Why were comments, Comments-URI, and Comment-Summary removed from the process?**  \n+    The comments feature saw insignificant adoption. Few BIPs received any comments and barely any more than two with\n+    only a handful of contributors commenting at all. This led to many situations in which one or two comments ended up\n+    dominating the comment summary. While some of those comments may have been representative of broadly held opinions,\n+    it also overstated the importance of individual comments directly in the Preamble of BIPs. As collecting feedback in\n+    this accessible fashion failed, the new process puts the onus back on the audience to make their own evaluation.\n+[^layer]: **Why is the layer header now permitted for other BIP types?**  \n+    The layer header had already been used by many Informational BIPs, so the rule that it is only available to\n+    Standards Track BIPs is dropped.\n+[^OtherImplementations]: **What is the issue with \"Other Implementations\" sections in BIPs?**  \n+    In the past, some BIPs had \"Other Implementations\" sections that caused frequent change requests to existing BIPs.\n+    This put an onus on the BIP authors, and frequently led to lingering pull requests due to the corresponding BIPsâ€™\n+    authors no longer participating in the process. Many of these alternative implementations eventually became\n+    unmaintained or were low-quality to begin with. Therefore, \"Other Implementations\" sections are heavily discouraged.\n+[^complete]: **Why was the Proposed status renamed to Complete?**  \n+    Some reviewers of this BIP raised that in a process which outlines the workflow of Bitcoin Improvement _Proposals_\n+    using \"Proposed\" as a status field value was overloading the term: clearly _proposals_ are proposed at all stages of\n+    the process. \"Complete\" expresses that the authors have concluded planned work on all parts of the proposal and are\n+    ready to recommend their BIP for adoption. The term \"ready\" was also considered, but considered too subjective.\n+[^rejection]: **Why can proposals remain in Draft or Complete indefinitely?**  \n+    The automatic 3-year timeout of BIPs has led to some disagreement in the past and seems unnecessary in cases where\n+    the authors are still active in the community and still considers their idea worth pursuing. On the other hand,\n+    proposals that appear stale may be tested and cleared out after only one year which should achieve the main goal of\n+    the original rule.\n+[^closed]: **Why was the Closed Status introduced?**  \n+    Previously, the process had Deferred, Obsolete, Rejected, Replaced, and Withdrawn which all meant some flavor of\n+    \"work has stopped on this\". The many statuses complicated the process, may have contributed to process fatigue, and\n+    may have resulted in BIPsâ€™ statuses not being maintained well. The author of this BIP feels that all of the\n+    aforementioned can be represented by _Closed_ without significantly impacting the information quality of the\n+    overview table. Where the many Status variants provided minuscule additional information, the simplification is more\n+    valuable and the Changelog section now collects specific details.\n+[^acceptance]: **Why does the BIP repository no longer track adoption?**  \n+    BIPâ€¯2 made an attempt to gather community feedback into comment summaries in BIPs directly. Given the low adoption\n+    and corresponding low information quality of the summaries that resulted from that feature, this BIP instead intends\n+    to leave the evaluation of BIPs to the audience.\n+[^markdown]: **Which flavor of markdown is allowed?**  \n+    The author of this proposal has no opinion on Markdown flavors, but recommends that proposals stick to the basic\n+    Markdown syntax features commonly shared across Markdown dialects.\n+[^living-documents]: **Why are Process BIPs living documents?**  \n+    In the past years, the existing BIPs process has not always provided a clear approach to all situations. For\n+    example, the content of BIPâ€¯2 appears to have been penned especially with fork proposals in mind. It seems clear\n+    that bitcoin development will evolve in many surprising ways in the future. Instead of mandating the effort of\n+    writing a new process document every time new situations arise, it seems preferable to allow the process to adapt to\n+    the concerns of the future in specific aspects. Therefore, Process BIPs are defined as living documents that remain\n+    open to amendment. If a Process BIP requires large modifications or even a complete overhaul, a new BIP should be\n+    preferred.\n+[^new-BIP]: **Why should the specification of an implemented BIP no longer be changed?**  \n+    After a Complete or Deployed BIP have been deployed by one or more implementations, breaking changes to the",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up to\n+the relevant project directly.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors what issues may arise in its progression. After some investigation,\n+the novelty of an idea can be tested by posting about it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). Prior correspondence can be found in the [mailing list\n+archive](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/).\n+\n+Vetting an idea publicly before investing the time to formally describe the idea is meant to save both the authors and\n+the broader community time. Not only may someone point out relevant discussion topics that were missed in the authorsâ€™\n+research, or that an idea is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions, but describing an idea publicly also\n+tests whether it is of interest to more people besides the authors. After establishing that the idea may be of interest\n+to the bitcoin community, the authors should work on drafting a BIP.\n+\n+As a first sketch of the proposal is taking shape, the authors should present it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). This gives the authors a chance to collect initial feedback and address\n+fundamental concerns. If the authors wish to work in public on the proposal at this stage, it is recommended that they\n+open a pull request against one of their forks of the BIP repository instead of the main BIP repository.\n+\n+It is recommended that complicated proposals be split into separate BIPs that each focus on a specific component of the\n+overall proposal.\n+\n+### Progression through BIP Statuses\n+\n+The following sections refer to BIP Status Field values. The BIP Status Field is defined in the Header Preamble\n+specification above.\n+\n+#### Draft\n+\n+After fleshing out the proposal further and ensuring that it is of high quality and properly formatted, the authors\n+should open a pull request to the [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips). The document must adhere to the\n+formatting requirements specified below and should be provided as a file named with a working title of the form\n+\"bip-title.[md|mediawiki]\". The authors must not self-assign a number to their proposal.\n+\n+BIPs that (1) adhere to the formatting requirements, (2) are on-topic, and (3) have materially progressed beyond the\n+ideation phase, e.g. by generating substantial public discussion and commentary from diverse contributors, by\n+independent bitcoin projects working on adopting the proposal, or by the authors working for an extended period toward\n+improving the proposal based on community feedback, will be assigned a number by a BIP editor. The BIP editors should\n+delay number assignment when they perceive a proposal being met with lack of interest: number assignment facilitates the\n+distributed discussion of ideas, but before a proposal garners some interest in the bitcoin community, there is no need\n+to refer to it by a number.\n+\n+Proposals are also not ready for number assignment if they duplicate efforts, disregard formatting rules, are too\n+unfocused or too broad, fail to provide proper motivation, fail to address backwards compatibility where necessary, or\n+fail to specify the feature clearly and comprehensively. Reviewers and BIP editors should provide guidance on how the\n+proposal may be improved to progress toward readiness. Pull requests that are proposing off-topic or unserious ideas or\n+have stopped to make progress may be closed.\n+\n+When the proposal is ready and has been assigned a number, a BIP editor will merge it into the BIP repository. After the\n+BIP has been merged to the repository, its main focus should no longer shift significantly, even while the authors may\n+continue to update the proposal as necessary. Updates to merged documents by the authors should also be submitted as\n+pull requests.\n+\n+#### Complete[^complete]\n+\n+When the authors have concluded all planned work on their proposal, are confident that their BIP represents a net\n+improvement, is clear, comprehensive, has a working reference implementation and test vectors (if applicable), and is\n+ready for adoption by the bitcoin community, they may update the BIPâ€™s status to Complete to indicate that they\n+recommend adoption, implementation, or deployment of the BIP. Where applicable, the authors must ensure that any\n+proposed specification is solid, not unduly complicated, and definitive. Subsequently, the BIPâ€™s content should only be\n+adjusted in minor details, e.g. to improve language, clarify ambiguities, backfill omissions in the specification, add\n+test vectors for edge cases, or address other issues discovered as the BIP is being adopted.\n+\n+A Complete BIP can only move to Deployed or Closed. Any necessary changes to the specification should be minimal and\n+interfere as little as possible with ongoing adoption. If a Complete BIP is found to need substantial functional\n+changes, it may be preferable to move it to Closed[^new-BIP], and to start a new BIP with the changes instead.\n+Otherwise, it could cause confusion as to what being compliant with the BIP means.\n+\n+Complete is the final state for most successful Informational BIPs.\n+\n+#### Deployed\n+\n+A settled[^settled] BIP may be advanced to Deployed upon request by any community member with evidence that the idea\n+described in the BIP is in active use. Such evidence includes for example: at least one project having deployed support\n+for the BIP in mainnet software releases, a soft fork proposalâ€™s activation criteria having been met on the network, or\n+rough consensus for the BIP having been demonstrated.\n+\n+At that point, the BIP should be considered final and any breaking changes to the BIP should be proposed as a new\n+separate BIP.[^new-BIP]\n+\n+##### Process BIPs\n+\n+A Process BIP may change status from Complete to Deployed when it achieves rough consensus on the mailing list. Such a\n+proposal is said to have rough consensus if it has been open to discussion on the development mailing list for at least\n+one month, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it. Addressed or obstructive objections\n+may be ignored/overruled by general agreement that they have been sufficiently addressed, but clear reasoning must be\n+given in such circumstances. Deployed Process BIPs may be modified indefinitely as long as a proposed modification has\n+rough consensus per the same criteria.[^living-documents]\n+\n+#### Closed[^closed]\n+\n+A BIP that is _not in active use_, may be labeled Closed when its authors have stopped working on it, no longer\n+recommend the proposed approach, or no longer pursue adoption of their Complete proposal. The reason for moving the\n+proposal to Closed should be recorded in the Changelog section in the same commit that updates the status.\n+\n+##### Draft â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIP authors may decide on their own to change their BIPâ€™s status from Draft to Closed. If a Draft BIP stops making\n+progress, sees accumulated feedback unaddressed, or otherwise appears stalled for a year, the community may move the BIP\n+to Closed unless the authors assert that they intend to continue work when contacted.\n+\n+##### Complete â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIPs that had attained the Complete status, i.e. that had been recommended for adoption, may be moved to Closed per the\n+authorsâ€™ announcement to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List after not being opposed within four weeks. To successfully\n+oppose the move, at least one of the opposers must volunteer to become the BIPâ€™s author or shepherd for the BIP to\n+remain Complete. A BIP can also be moved to Closed by the community if it has had Complete status for at least one year,\n+there is no evidence of it being in active use, and its authors do not object or fail to respond, unless a new author\n+volunteers within four weeks.\n+\n+##### Deployed â†¦ Closed\n+\n+A BIP may evolve from Deployed to Closed when it is no longer in active use. Any community member may initiate this\n+Status update by announcing it to the mailing list, and proceed if no objections have been raised for four weeks.\n+\n+##### Closed â†¦ Draft\n+\n+The Closed status is generally intended to be a final status for BIPs.\n+\n+If BIP authors decide to make another attempt at a previously Closed BIP, it is generally recommended to create a new\n+proposal. (Obviously, the authors may borrow any amount of inspiration or actual text from any prior BIPs as licensing\n+permits.) The authors should take special care to address the issues that caused the prior attemptâ€™s abandonment. Even\n+if the prior attempt had been assigned a number, the new BIP will generally be assigned a distinct number, unless it is\n+obvious that the new attempt directly continues work on the same idea, in which case it may be reasonable to return the\n+Closed BIP to Draft status.\n+\n+### Changelog\n+\n+To help implementers understand updates to a BIP, any changes after it has reached Complete are tracked with version,\n+date, and description in a Changelog section. The version number is inspired by semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).\n+The MAJOR version is incremented if changes to the BIPâ€™s Specification are introduced that are incompatible with prior\n+versions (which should be rare after a BIP is Complete, and only happen in well-grounded exceptional cases to a BIP that\n+is Deployed). The MINOR version is incremented whenever the specification of the BIP is changed or extended in a\n+backward-compatible way. The PATCH version is incremented for other changes to the BIP that are noteworthy (bug fixes,\n+test vectors, important clarifications, etc.). The version should start at 1.0.0 with the date the BIP was promoted to\n+Complete. An example of a Changelog section can be seen in\n+[BIPâ€¯352](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0352.mediawiki). After a BIP receives a Changelog, the\n+Preamble must indicate the latest version in the Revision header.\n+\n+### Adoption of proposals\n+\n+The BIP repository does not track the sentiment on proposals and does not track the adoption of BIPs beyond whether they\n+are in active use or not. It is not intended for BIPs to list additional implementations beyond the reference\n+implementation: the BIP repository is not a signpost where to find implementations.[^OtherImplementations] After a BIP\n+is advanced to Complete, it is up to the bitcoin community to evaluate, adopt, ignore, or reject a BIP. Individual\n+bitcoin projects are encouraged to publish a list of BIPs they implement. A good example of this at the time of writing\n+this BIP can be observed in Bitcoin Coreâ€™s [doc/bips.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/bips.md)\n+file.\n+\n+### Transferring BIP Ownership\n+\n+It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of BIPs to new owners. In general, it would be preferable to\n+retain the original authors of the transferred BIP, but that is up to the original authors. A good reason to transfer\n+ownership is because the original authors no longer have the time or interest in updating it or following through with\n+the BIP process, or have fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. are unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason\n+to transfer ownership is because someone doesn't agree with the direction of the BIP. The community tries to build\n+consensus around a BIP, but if that's not possible, rather than fighting over control, the dissenters should supply a\n+competing BIP.\n+\n+If someone is interested in assuming ownership of a BIP, they should send an email asking to take over, addressed to the\n+original authors, the BIPâ€¯Editors, and the Bitcoin Development Mailing List. If the authors do not respond in a timely\n+manner (e.g. two weeks), the BIP editors will make a unilateral decision whether to appoint the applicants as\n+[Shepherds](#authors-and-shepherds) (which may be amended should the original authors make a delayed reappearance).\n+\n+## BIP Licensing\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+Each new BIP must identify at least one acceptable license in its preamble. Licenses must be referenced per their\n+respective [SPDX License identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses). New BIPs may be accepted with the licenses described\n+below.\n+\n+For example, a preamble might include the following License header:\n+\n+    License: CC0-1.0\n+             GNU-All-Permissive\n+\n+In this case, the BIP text is fully licensed under both the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license as well as the\n+GNU All-Permissive License, and anyone may modify and redistribute the text provided they comply with the terms of\n+*either* license. In other words, the license list is an \"OR choice\", not an \"AND also\" requirement.\n+\n+It is also possible to license source code differently from the BIP text by including the optional License-Code header\n+after the License header. Again, each license must be referenced by their respective SPDX License identifier shown\n+below.\n+\n+Each source code file or source directory should specify the license under which it is made available as is common in\n+software (e.g. with a license header or a LICENSE/COPYING file). It is recommended to make any test vectors available\n+under CC0-1.0 or GNU-All-Permissive in addition to any other licenses to allow anyone to copy test vectors into their\n+implementations without introducing license hindrances. Licenses listed in the License-Code header apply to all source\n+directories, source code files, and test vectors provided with the BIP except those where a LICENSE file in a directory\n+or the file header states otherwise.\n+\n+For example, a preamble specifying the optional License-Code header might look like:\n+\n+    License:         CC0-1.0\n+    License-Code:    MIT\n+\n+In this case, the code in the BIP is not available under CC0-1.0, but is only available under the terms of the MIT\n+License.\n+\n+BIPs are not required to be *exclusively* licensed under approved terms, and may also be licensed under unacceptable\n+licenses *in addition to* at least one acceptable license. In this case, only the acceptable license(s) should be listed\n+in the License and License-Code headers.\n+\n+It is recommended that BIPs that include literal code be licensed under the same license terms as the project it\n+modifies. For example, literal code intended for Bitcoin Core would ideally be licensed (or dual-licensed) under the MIT\n+license terms.\n+\n+In all cases, details of the licensing terms must be provided in the Copyright section of the BIP.\n+\n+#### Acceptable licenses[^licenses]\n+\n+* BSD-2-Clause: [OSI-approved BSD 2-clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)\n+* BSD-3-Clause: [OSI-approved BSD 3-clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)\n+* CC0-1.0: [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\n+* GNU-All-Permissive: [GNU All-Permissive License](http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/License-Notices-for-Other-Files.html)\n+* CC-BY-4.0: [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n+* CC-BY-SA-4.0: [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)\n+* MIT: [Expat/MIT/X11 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n+\n+#### Not acceptable licenses\n+\n+All licenses not explicitly included in the above lists are not acceptable terms for a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal.\n+However, BIPs predating the acceptance of this BIP were allowed under other terms, and should use these abbreviations\n+when no other license is granted:\n+\n+* PD: Released into the public domain\n+* OPL: [Open Publication License, version 1.0](http://opencontent.org/openpub/)\n+\n+## BIP Editors\n+\n+The current BIP editors are:\n+\n+* Bryan Bishop ([kanzure@gmail.com](mailto:kanzure@gmail.com))\n+* Jon Atack ([jon@atack.com](mailto:jon@atack.com))\n+* Luke Dashjr ([luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org](mailto:luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org))\n+* Mark \"Murch\" Erhardt ([murch@murch.one](mailto:murch@murch.one))\n+* Olaoluwa Osuntokun ([laolu32@gmail.com](mailto:laolu32@gmail.com))\n+* Ruben Somsen ([rsomsen@gmail.com](mailto:rsomsen@gmail.com))\n+\n+### BIP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow\n+\n+The BIP editors subscribe to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List and watch the [BIPs\n+repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips).\n+\n+When a new BIP idea is submitted to the mailing list, BIP editors and other community members should comment in regard\n+to:\n+\n+* Novelty of the idea\n+* Viability, utility, and relevance of the concept\n+* Readiness of the proposal\n+* On-topic for the bitcoin community\n+\n+Discussion in pull request comments can often be hard to follow as feedback gets marked as resolved when it is addressed\n+by authors. Substantive discussion of ideas may be more accessible to a broader audience on the mailing list, where it\n+is also more likely to be retained by the community memory.\n+\n+If the BIP needs more work, an editor should ensure that constructive, actionable feedback is provided to the authors\n+for revision. Once the BIP is ready it should be submitted as a \"pull request\" to the [BIPs\n+repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) where it may get further feedback.\n+\n+For each new BIP pull request that comes in, an editor checks the following:\n+\n+* The idea has been previously discussed on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List\n+* Title accurately describes the content\n+* Proposal is of general interest and/or pertains to more than one bitcoin project/implementation\n+* Document is properly formatted\n+* Licensing terms are acceptable\n+* Motivation, Rationale, and Backward Compatibility have been addressed\n+* Specification provides sufficient detail for implementation\n+* The defined Layer header must be correctly assigned for the given specification\n+* The BIP is ready: it is comprehensible, technically feasible, and all aspects are addressed as necessary\n+\n+Editors do NOT evaluate whether the proposal is likely to be adopted.\n+\n+A BIP editor will:\n+\n+* Assign a BIP number and BIP type in the pull request\n+* Merge the pull request when it is ready\n+* List the BIP in the [README](README.mediawiki)",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up to\n+the relevant project directly.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors what issues may arise in its progression. After some investigation,\n+the novelty of an idea can be tested by posting about it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). Prior correspondence can be found in the [mailing list\n+archive](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/).\n+\n+Vetting an idea publicly before investing the time to formally describe the idea is meant to save both the authors and\n+the broader community time. Not only may someone point out relevant discussion topics that were missed in the authorsâ€™\n+research, or that an idea is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions, but describing an idea publicly also\n+tests whether it is of interest to more people besides the authors. After establishing that the idea may be of interest\n+to the bitcoin community, the authors should work on drafting a BIP.\n+\n+As a first sketch of the proposal is taking shape, the authors should present it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). This gives the authors a chance to collect initial feedback and address\n+fundamental concerns. If the authors wish to work in public on the proposal at this stage, it is recommended that they\n+open a pull request against one of their forks of the BIP repository instead of the main BIP repository.\n+\n+It is recommended that complicated proposals be split into separate BIPs that each focus on a specific component of the\n+overall proposal.\n+\n+### Progression through BIP Statuses\n+\n+The following sections refer to BIP Status Field values. The BIP Status Field is defined in the Header Preamble\n+specification above.\n+\n+#### Draft\n+\n+After fleshing out the proposal further and ensuring that it is of high quality and properly formatted, the authors\n+should open a pull request to the [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips). The document must adhere to the\n+formatting requirements specified below and should be provided as a file named with a working title of the form\n+\"bip-title.[md|mediawiki]\". The authors must not self-assign a number to their proposal.\n+\n+BIPs that (1) adhere to the formatting requirements, (2) are on-topic, and (3) have materially progressed beyond the\n+ideation phase, e.g. by generating substantial public discussion and commentary from diverse contributors, by\n+independent bitcoin projects working on adopting the proposal, or by the authors working for an extended period toward\n+improving the proposal based on community feedback, will be assigned a number by a BIP editor. The BIP editors should\n+delay number assignment when they perceive a proposal being met with lack of interest: number assignment facilitates the\n+distributed discussion of ideas, but before a proposal garners some interest in the bitcoin community, there is no need\n+to refer to it by a number.\n+\n+Proposals are also not ready for number assignment if they duplicate efforts, disregard formatting rules, are too\n+unfocused or too broad, fail to provide proper motivation, fail to address backwards compatibility where necessary, or\n+fail to specify the feature clearly and comprehensively. Reviewers and BIP editors should provide guidance on how the\n+proposal may be improved to progress toward readiness. Pull requests that are proposing off-topic or unserious ideas or\n+have stopped to make progress may be closed.\n+\n+When the proposal is ready and has been assigned a number, a BIP editor will merge it into the BIP repository. After the\n+BIP has been merged to the repository, its main focus should no longer shift significantly, even while the authors may\n+continue to update the proposal as necessary. Updates to merged documents by the authors should also be submitted as\n+pull requests.\n+\n+#### Complete[^complete]\n+\n+When the authors have concluded all planned work on their proposal, are confident that their BIP represents a net\n+improvement, is clear, comprehensive, has a working reference implementation and test vectors (if applicable), and is\n+ready for adoption by the bitcoin community, they may update the BIPâ€™s status to Complete to indicate that they\n+recommend adoption, implementation, or deployment of the BIP. Where applicable, the authors must ensure that any\n+proposed specification is solid, not unduly complicated, and definitive. Subsequently, the BIPâ€™s content should only be\n+adjusted in minor details, e.g. to improve language, clarify ambiguities, backfill omissions in the specification, add\n+test vectors for edge cases, or address other issues discovered as the BIP is being adopted.\n+\n+A Complete BIP can only move to Deployed or Closed. Any necessary changes to the specification should be minimal and\n+interfere as little as possible with ongoing adoption. If a Complete BIP is found to need substantial functional\n+changes, it may be preferable to move it to Closed[^new-BIP], and to start a new BIP with the changes instead.\n+Otherwise, it could cause confusion as to what being compliant with the BIP means.\n+\n+Complete is the final state for most successful Informational BIPs.\n+\n+#### Deployed\n+\n+A settled[^settled] BIP may be advanced to Deployed upon request by any community member with evidence that the idea\n+described in the BIP is in active use. Such evidence includes for example: at least one project having deployed support\n+for the BIP in mainnet software releases, a soft fork proposalâ€™s activation criteria having been met on the network, or\n+rough consensus for the BIP having been demonstrated.\n+\n+At that point, the BIP should be considered final and any breaking changes to the BIP should be proposed as a new\n+separate BIP.[^new-BIP]\n+\n+##### Process BIPs\n+\n+A Process BIP may change status from Complete to Deployed when it achieves rough consensus on the mailing list. Such a\n+proposal is said to have rough consensus if it has been open to discussion on the development mailing list for at least\n+one month, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it. Addressed or obstructive objections\n+may be ignored/overruled by general agreement that they have been sufficiently addressed, but clear reasoning must be\n+given in such circumstances. Deployed Process BIPs may be modified indefinitely as long as a proposed modification has\n+rough consensus per the same criteria.[^living-documents]\n+\n+#### Closed[^closed]\n+\n+A BIP that is _not in active use_, may be labeled Closed when its authors have stopped working on it, no longer\n+recommend the proposed approach, or no longer pursue adoption of their Complete proposal. The reason for moving the\n+proposal to Closed should be recorded in the Changelog section in the same commit that updates the status.\n+\n+##### Draft â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIP authors may decide on their own to change their BIPâ€™s status from Draft to Closed. If a Draft BIP stops making\n+progress, sees accumulated feedback unaddressed, or otherwise appears stalled for a year, the community may move the BIP\n+to Closed unless the authors assert that they intend to continue work when contacted.\n+\n+##### Complete â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIPs that had attained the Complete status, i.e. that had been recommended for adoption, may be moved to Closed per the\n+authorsâ€™ announcement to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List after not being opposed within four weeks. To successfully\n+oppose the move, at least one of the opposers must volunteer to become the BIPâ€™s author or shepherd for the BIP to\n+remain Complete. A BIP can also be moved to Closed by the community if it has had Complete status for at least one year,\n+there is no evidence of it being in active use, and its authors do not object or fail to respond, unless a new author\n+volunteers within four weeks.\n+\n+##### Deployed â†¦ Closed\n+\n+A BIP may evolve from Deployed to Closed when it is no longer in active use. Any community member may initiate this\n+Status update by announcing it to the mailing list, and proceed if no objections have been raised for four weeks.\n+\n+##### Closed â†¦ Draft\n+\n+The Closed status is generally intended to be a final status for BIPs.\n+\n+If BIP authors decide to make another attempt at a previously Closed BIP, it is generally recommended to create a new\n+proposal. (Obviously, the authors may borrow any amount of inspiration or actual text from any prior BIPs as licensing\n+permits.) The authors should take special care to address the issues that caused the prior attemptâ€™s abandonment. Even\n+if the prior attempt had been assigned a number, the new BIP will generally be assigned a distinct number, unless it is\n+obvious that the new attempt directly continues work on the same idea, in which case it may be reasonable to return the\n+Closed BIP to Draft status.\n+\n+### Changelog\n+\n+To help implementers understand updates to a BIP, any changes after it has reached Complete are tracked with version,\n+date, and description in a Changelog section. The version number is inspired by semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).\n+The MAJOR version is incremented if changes to the BIPâ€™s Specification are introduced that are incompatible with prior\n+versions (which should be rare after a BIP is Complete, and only happen in well-grounded exceptional cases to a BIP that\n+is Deployed). The MINOR version is incremented whenever the specification of the BIP is changed or extended in a\n+backward-compatible way. The PATCH version is incremented for other changes to the BIP that are noteworthy (bug fixes,\n+test vectors, important clarifications, etc.). The version should start at 1.0.0 with the date the BIP was promoted to\n+Complete. An example of a Changelog section can be seen in\n+[BIPâ€¯352](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0352.mediawiki). After a BIP receives a Changelog, the\n+Preamble must indicate the latest version in the Revision header.\n+\n+### Adoption of proposals\n+\n+The BIP repository does not track the sentiment on proposals and does not track the adoption of BIPs beyond whether they\n+are in active use or not. It is not intended for BIPs to list additional implementations beyond the reference\n+implementation: the BIP repository is not a signpost where to find implementations.[^OtherImplementations] After a BIP\n+is advanced to Complete, it is up to the bitcoin community to evaluate, adopt, ignore, or reject a BIP. Individual\n+bitcoin projects are encouraged to publish a list of BIPs they implement. A good example of this at the time of writing\n+this BIP can be observed in Bitcoin Coreâ€™s [doc/bips.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/bips.md)\n+file.\n+\n+### Transferring BIP Ownership\n+\n+It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of BIPs to new owners. In general, it would be preferable to\n+retain the original authors of the transferred BIP, but that is up to the original authors. A good reason to transfer\n+ownership is because the original authors no longer have the time or interest in updating it or following through with\n+the BIP process, or have fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. are unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason\n+to transfer ownership is because someone doesn't agree with the direction of the BIP. The community tries to build\n+consensus around a BIP, but if that's not possible, rather than fighting over control, the dissenters should supply a\n+competing BIP.\n+\n+If someone is interested in assuming ownership of a BIP, they should send an email asking to take over, addressed to the\n+original authors, the BIPâ€¯Editors, and the Bitcoin Development Mailing List. If the authors do not respond in a timely\n+manner (e.g. two weeks), the BIP editors will make a unilateral decision whether to appoint the applicants as\n+[Shepherds](#authors-and-shepherds) (which may be amended should the original authors make a delayed reappearance).\n+\n+## BIP Licensing\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+Each new BIP must identify at least one acceptable license in its preamble. Licenses must be referenced per their\n+respective [SPDX License identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses). New BIPs may be accepted with the licenses described\n+below.\n+\n+For example, a preamble might include the following License header:\n+\n+    License: CC0-1.0\n+             GNU-All-Permissive\n+\n+In this case, the BIP text is fully licensed under both the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license as well as the\n+GNU All-Permissive License, and anyone may modify and redistribute the text provided they comply with the terms of\n+*either* license. In other words, the license list is an \"OR choice\", not an \"AND also\" requirement.\n+\n+It is also possible to license source code differently from the BIP text by including the optional License-Code header\n+after the License header. Again, each license must be referenced by their respective SPDX License identifier shown\n+below.\n+\n+Each source code file or source directory should specify the license under which it is made available as is common in\n+software (e.g. with a license header or a LICENSE/COPYING file). It is recommended to make any test vectors available\n+under CC0-1.0 or GNU-All-Permissive in addition to any other licenses to allow anyone to copy test vectors into their\n+implementations without introducing license hindrances. Licenses listed in the License-Code header apply to all source\n+directories, source code files, and test vectors provided with the BIP except those where a LICENSE file in a directory\n+or the file header states otherwise.\n+\n+For example, a preamble specifying the optional License-Code header might look like:\n+\n+    License:         CC0-1.0\n+    License-Code:    MIT\n+\n+In this case, the code in the BIP is not available under CC0-1.0, but is only available under the terms of the MIT\n+License.\n+\n+BIPs are not required to be *exclusively* licensed under approved terms, and may also be licensed under unacceptable\n+licenses *in addition to* at least one acceptable license. In this case, only the acceptable license(s) should be listed\n+in the License and License-Code headers.\n+\n+It is recommended that BIPs that include literal code be licensed under the same license terms as the project it\n+modifies. For example, literal code intended for Bitcoin Core would ideally be licensed (or dual-licensed) under the MIT\n+license terms.\n+\n+In all cases, details of the licensing terms must be provided in the Copyright section of the BIP.\n+\n+#### Acceptable licenses[^licenses]\n+\n+* BSD-2-Clause: [OSI-approved BSD 2-clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)\n+* BSD-3-Clause: [OSI-approved BSD 3-clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)\n+* CC0-1.0: [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\n+* GNU-All-Permissive: [GNU All-Permissive License](http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/License-Notices-for-Other-Files.html)\n+* CC-BY-4.0: [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n+* CC-BY-SA-4.0: [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)\n+* MIT: [Expat/MIT/X11 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n+\n+#### Not acceptable licenses\n+\n+All licenses not explicitly included in the above lists are not acceptable terms for a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal.\n+However, BIPs predating the acceptance of this BIP were allowed under other terms, and should use these abbreviations\n+when no other license is granted:\n+\n+* PD: Released into the public domain\n+* OPL: [Open Publication License, version 1.0](http://opencontent.org/openpub/)\n+\n+## BIP Editors\n+\n+The current BIP editors are:\n+\n+* Bryan Bishop ([kanzure@gmail.com](mailto:kanzure@gmail.com))\n+* Jon Atack ([jon@atack.com](mailto:jon@atack.com))\n+* Luke Dashjr ([luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org](mailto:luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org))\n+* Mark \"Murch\" Erhardt ([murch@murch.one](mailto:murch@murch.one))\n+* Olaoluwa Osuntokun ([laolu32@gmail.com](mailto:laolu32@gmail.com))\n+* Ruben Somsen ([rsomsen@gmail.com](mailto:rsomsen@gmail.com))\n+\n+### BIP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow\n+\n+The BIP editors subscribe to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List and watch the [BIPs\n+repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips).\n+\n+When a new BIP idea is submitted to the mailing list, BIP editors and other community members should comment in regard\n+to:\n+\n+* Novelty of the idea\n+* Viability, utility, and relevance of the concept\n+* Readiness of the proposal\n+* On-topic for the bitcoin community\n+\n+Discussion in pull request comments can often be hard to follow as feedback gets marked as resolved when it is addressed\n+by authors. Substantive discussion of ideas may be more accessible to a broader audience on the mailing list, where it\n+is also more likely to be retained by the community memory.\n+\n+If the BIP needs more work, an editor should ensure that constructive, actionable feedback is provided to the authors\n+for revision. Once the BIP is ready it should be submitted as a \"pull request\" to the [BIPs\n+repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) where it may get further feedback.\n+\n+For each new BIP pull request that comes in, an editor checks the following:\n+\n+* The idea has been previously discussed on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List\n+* Title accurately describes the content\n+* Proposal is of general interest and/or pertains to more than one bitcoin project/implementation\n+* Document is properly formatted\n+* Licensing terms are acceptable\n+* Motivation, Rationale, and Backward Compatibility have been addressed\n+* Specification provides sufficient detail for implementation\n+* The defined Layer header must be correctly assigned for the given specification\n+* The BIP is ready: it is comprehensible, technically feasible, and all aspects are addressed as necessary\n+\n+Editors do NOT evaluate whether the proposal is likely to be adopted.\n+\n+A BIP editor will:\n+\n+* Assign a BIP number and BIP type in the pull request\n+* Merge the pull request when it is ready\n+* List the BIP in the [README](README.mediawiki)\n+\n+The BIP editors are intended to fulfill administrative and editorial responsibilities. The BIP editors monitor BIP\n+changes, and update BIP headers as appropriate.\n+\n+BIP editors may also, at their option, unilaterally make and merge strictly editorial changes to BIPs, such as\n+correcting misspellings, fixing broken links, etc. as long as they do not change the meaning or conflict with the\n+original intent of the authors. Such a change must be recorded in the Changelog if itâ€™s noteworthy per the criteria\n+mentioned in the [Changelog](#changelog) section.\n+\n+## Backward Compatibility\n+\n+### Changes from BIPâ€¯2",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the",

      "body": "The distinction can make a difference when it comes to copyright. I agree that a single role is simpler in terms of the process, but I believe this is what is implemented here. We have effectively a single Owner *role* (and the Owners are the union of Authors and Shepherds), but additionally an author *field* (which is pure metadata and doesn't have implications for the process). \r\n\r\nNow, I agree that this is a bit difficult to explain... \r\n\r\nPerhaps there should just be two required fields \"Owners\" and \"Authors\". This sounds like overkill because it leads to duplication. But if you think about it, I believe it's simpler than the current draft:  it avoids the term Shepherd entirely, and in the text, you can easily pick the appropriate term on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there may be an author who is not an owner (anymore). Not sure if we'll ever need this, but there's no good reason to exclude it upfront.",
