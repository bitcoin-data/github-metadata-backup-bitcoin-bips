If our code starts to reject \"payments\", then better be authorized by the standard.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that this PR right now only includes the absolute minimum change; happy to include further changes if demanded (reflect this in the Python implementation, add test case), but not sure what are common rules for BIP amendments and if additional changes are worth it for a corner-case. For an additional test vector, one could take the example tx that has been published on signet: [d73f4a19f3973e90af6df62e735bb7b31f3d5ab8e7e26e7950651b436d093313](https://mempool.space/signet/tx/d73f4a19f3973e90af6df62e735bb7b31f3d5ab8e7e26e7950651b436d093313)",

And then if the text is changed, then the Python code should also be changed.\r\n\r\nAgree, done. Note that with the secp256k1 module used here (it's the one Bitcoin Core used in the test framework before https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26222 was merged), there seems to be no obvious way to check if a public key corresponds to point at infinity, so it's checked indirectly if its serialization (`.get_bytes()`) returns None. I thought that it's maybe worth it to update the secp256k1 implementation to one that follows best practices and has a nicer API (I think you were working on such a Python module, that'd probably be a good choice?), but that's of course outside of the scope of this PR.\r\n\r\n> I don't want to make it too complicated, but it may be a good idea to include a changelog, like we did in BIP327: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki#change-log (this one looks long because we started versioning even before the BIP was merged into the repo here...)\r\n\r\nSeems reasonable to me, curious to get opinions from the BIP authors about the details (verbosity, concrete versioning used etc.), happy to pick up suggestions.",

Since we are now checking for `a = 0`, I think its worth adding a test case for the sender side, as well.\r\n\r\nRegarding the changelog, I think this is a great suggestion and especially helpful when adding new test cases. I'd suggest adding one here and just reusing the semantic versioning system from BIP327.\r\n\r\n---\r\n(I realize this is a bit out of scope for this change, but I didn't see a way to open an issue on the BIPs repo for this discussion)\r\n\r\nMore generally, seems worth it to formalizing the changelog format and versioning scheme as part of BIP2 (or whichever process BIP makes sense), e.g. something like \"BIP should include a change log. If a change log is added it must use `MAJOR.MINOR.PATH` versioning scheme, where `MAJOR` is.. \" etc.\r\n\r\nI see a few BIPs have change logs in various formats, which got me thinking it would be nice to formalize it for consistency and also to avoid each BIP needing to either a) copy the text from another BIP explaining the change log or b) re-invent their own versioning scheme each time.",
