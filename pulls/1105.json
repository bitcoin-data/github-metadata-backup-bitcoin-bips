So no.\r\n- Limiting OP_RETURNs based on transaction count is not helpful, since the OP_RETURN size limit is a standardization rule only, so a miner could easily add 4M WU of OP_RETURN data in one tx if they wanted... so this BIP doesn't solve much.\r\n- The whole reason why OP_RETURNs were allowed to begin with was a compromise to prevent protocols using dummy pubkeys etc. to embed information. If OP_RETURN were limited in this way, they will just move back to hiding the data, making it harder to prune later on.\r\n- In general, limiting anything by transaction count in the consensus layer is problematic, because the whole point of blocks are to create transaction ordering, and by limiting any type of transaction to a single tx creates problems with ordering. Increasing risk of front-running those transactions for whatever reason. Since we can't be sure of the true meaning of any transaction (even a simple p2pkh) we should try not to add any consensus rule that increases that risk.",

Today there is a limitation of one OP_RETURN per transaction and each OP_RETURN is limited to 80 bytes of data. With very limited block space, it is essential to optimize the data stored in a block. Since a Merkle Tree [<a href=\"#references\">2</a>] or other similar data structures can be used to timestamp multiple documents by storing a single 32 byte checksum of the top of a Merkle Tree in a block, there is no reason to allow more than one OP_RETURN per block. If only a single OP_RETURN is allowed, per block, users will be required to coordinate in order to store individual checksums into this data structure, but this can be achieved by developing a layer two time-stamping protocol. This layer two time-stamping protocol will allow users to store thousands or even millions of checksums into a single block and at the same time limit the total amount of data in the block to 80 bytes. A future BIP proposing such a layer two protocol will be forthcoming. Use cases other than time-stamping will be harder to achieve with this proposal, and that is part of the goal of this BIP since those other use cases should be discouraged by the rules of the protocol.",

Optimizing the way Bitcoin stores notarization data is important. It is also important to enforce rules that require users to coordinate in a reasonable manner for the good of the community. This will lower transaction fees for all users and even lower transaction fees for users who wish to timestamp their own data. Miners will be incentivized by layer two protocol rewards. See [<a href=\"#references\">3</a>] for further discussion on the rationale.\n+\n+==Objections to this proposal==\n+\n+The main objection to this proposal will be the risk and effort required to execute a soft fork. It is important to note that other soft fork proposals may be incorporated into this proposal or this proposal may be incorporated into other proposals which mitigates this risk if the value of all the proposed fork features exceeds the costs. An additional objection may be that current applications make use of the OP_RETURN field and upgrading them will add cost. While this is true, the design of those applications was not optimal and this upgrade is needed. In the long run, it will reduce the running costs of those applications and optimize the use of block-space.\n+\n+==Compatibility==\n+\n+As a soft fork, older software will continue to operate without modification, but miners will need to upgrade before the soft fork activates. Additionally users using the OP_RETURN opcode will likely need to update their software to make use of a layer two standard instead of using OP_RETURN directly.",
