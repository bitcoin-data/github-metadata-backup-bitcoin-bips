If the median time of a block >= timeout and the soft fork has not yet locked in (including this block's bit state), the deployment is considered failed on all descendants of the block.\n+# The '''bit''' determines which bit in the nVersion field of the block is to be used to signal the soft fork lock-in and activation. It is chosen from the set {0,1,2,...,28}.\n+# The '''threshold''' specifies how many blocks within a single retarget period (2016 blocks) must have the bit set before we lock in the deployment. The recommended value is 1916 (95%) for mainnet and 1512 (75%) for testnets.\n+# The '''starttime''' specifies a minimum median time past of a block at which the bit gains its meaning.\n+# The '''timeout''' specifies a time at which the deployment is considered failed. If the median time past of a block >= timeout and the soft fork has not yet locked in (including this block's bit state), the deployment is considered failed on all descendants of the block.\n \n-===Mechanism===\n+No two deployments may use the same bit if they have overlapping starttime-timeout periods.\n \n-'''Bit flags'''\n-We are permitting several independent soft forks to be deployed in parallel. For each, a bit B is chosen from the set {0,1,2,...,28}, which is not currently in use for any other ongoing soft fork. Miners signal intent to enforce the new rules associated with the proposed soft fork by setting bit 1<sup>B</sup> in nVersion to 1 in their blocks.\n+The starttime should be set to some date in the future, coordinates with software release date. This is to prevent\n+triggers as a result of parties running pre-release software. The timeout should be set a reasonable time after the\n+starttime. Setting it to 3 years after the starttime would allow around 9 deployments to be initiated every year.\n \n-'''High bits'''\n-The highest 3 bits are set to 001, so the range of actually possible nVersion values is [0x20000000...0x3FFFFFFF], inclusive. This leaves two future upgrades for different mechanisms (top bits 010 and 011), while complying to the constraints set by BIP34 and BIP66. Having more than 29 available bits for parallel soft forks does not add anything anyway, as the (nVersion >= 3) requirement already makes that impossible.\n+====States====\n \n-'''States'''\n-With every softfork proposal we associate a state BState, which begins\n-at ''defined'', and can be ''locked-in'', ''activated'',\n-or ''failed''.
