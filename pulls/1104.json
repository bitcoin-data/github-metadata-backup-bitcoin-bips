    "body": "Adds mainnet and testnet3 activation parameters. This uses the \"speedy trial\" approach [0]  with some refinements to the exact mechanism [1], as implemented in bitcoin/bitcoin#21377 . Parameters are selected based on previous discussions [2] [3] [4]. The parameters are:\r\n\r\n* starttime = 2021-04-24 00:00 UTC\r\n* timeout = 2021-08-11 00:00 UTC\r\n* min_activation_height = 709632 (est mid November 2021, mainnet only)\r\n* threshold = 1815 / 2016 blocks (90%, mainnet only)\r\n\r\nIn terms of block heights, that will likely mean the first signalling period for mainnet should start at height 681408, approximately April 29th UTC, and will likely mean signalling will continue for 8 retarget periods until height 697536 (which if blocks arrived at 10 minute intervals, would be due around 2021-08-20).\r\n\r\n[0] https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018583.html\r\n[1] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21377#issuecomment-814494847\r\n[2] (90%) https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018425.html\r\n[3] (May/August/Nov) https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018715.html\r\n[4] (specific parameters) https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1081",

However, one could alternatively imagine just moving the timeout two weeks back if this is a concern. Am I missing the true reasons for changing the state transitions?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of changing these state transitions is to resolve one of the issues with BIP 9, specifically the one where miners can choose to skip the activation period. In this case, it was done in order to make MTP versionbits deployments more similar to BIP 8. Both changes are necessary in order to allow the guaranteed single signaling period be sufficient to activate the soft fork.\r\n\r\nConsider the following scenario: a MTP versionbits deployment where start time is at time A, and timeout time is at time B. Miners then perform a timewarp attack which keeps the MTP before time A, and then once real time passes time B, they timewarp to make MTP past time B.\r\n* With BIP 9, that soft fork would go from DEFINED to FAILED and the entire activation window is skipped. There are no signaling periods. Removing this possibility is touted as one of the benefits of BIP 8.\r\n* With only the change removing DEFINED -> FAILED, once MTP passes time A (so after it is pushed past time B), the soft fork becomes STARTED. However when the next period begins, it immediately transitions to FAILED because the time B is already passed. Signaling is not evaluated, and even if the threshold is reached in that period, it is not possible to activate. This is functionally equivalent to BIP 9.\r\n* With both state transition changes, once MTP passes time A, the soft fork becomes STARTED. When the next period begins, signaling is evaluated first, and if it is over the threshold, then the soft fork transitions to LOCKED_IN. If the threshold is not reached, it transitions to FAILED.\r\n\r\nThus both changes to the state machine are required in order to have at least one useful signaling period.\r\n\r\nNow you could have a debate about whether this is actually useful, but I proposed this change because it was one of the benefits provided by BIP 8. By doing these state machine changes, we are able to get similar signaling period guarantees that BIP 8 provides, and doing so seemed to be not invasive as well as somewhat simplifying the state machine",

      "body": "@jonasnick @achow101 \r\n\r\n> Now you could have a debate about whether this is actually useful, but I proposed this change because it was one of the benefits provided by BIP 8.\r\n\r\nI think for speedy trial the practical difference between these state changes and adding an extra two weeks to the timeout for mainnet is effectively zero. (For testnet3 two weeks might be more than one period, so that might have measurably different behaviour, but not in any important way)\r\n\r\nBut I think there was a benefit in making it easier for some people to review: if you're reviewing by checking that the final result makes sense, the final result being simpler is a big win. (That's a trade off against making it harder for reviewers who were comfortable with the old code and are verifying the differences, because there are more differences; but it seems to me there aren't that many people who understand the current code in depth for that to work, and so this was a good trade off to make)",

However, because we have not finalized consensus for height-based landmarks, pure BIP9 ST is what I think we should go with. I would very much like to see improvements to BIP9 move forward *concurrently with* and *independently of* a BIP9 Speedy Trial. But I strongly disagree that improvements to the deployment process should block taproot. However, if the fastest way to taproot is via upgrading BIP9 with height-based landmarks in replacement of MTP, or using a LOT=false BIP8, I would happily ACK that as well. LOT=true I very much NACK however, since it guarantees chain splits in all but the least contentious cases. ",

There are a number of things that make me uncomfortable about this.\r\n\r\n1) There is only one contributor (this PR author) who is NACKing a consistent use of block height (which would also allow it to fit neatly into BIP 8 that has already been reviewed). The rationale he has given for NACKing a consistent use of block height is because MTP is better for test networks. I do not think this is a reasonable rationale for NACKing a choice for a consensus code change on mainnet. \r\n\r\n2) There are two NACKs against using MTP, both from long term contributors. One from the author of an activation BIP (BIP 8) and another from the author of a MTP BIP (BIP 113).\r\n\r\n3) I suspect (though this is admittedly pure speculation) that many of the slight preferences listed (including myself) are trying to be as reasonable as we possibly can because we don't want to delay Taproot activation any further. But I don't think any of us understand why test networks are a reason to NACK consistent use of block heights. Nor do we understand why a competing PR (now closed) had to be opened because the PR author felt so strongly about using MTP (and not a consistent use of block heights).\r\n\r\n4) There is an [alternative client](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018783.html) that was intending to be compatible with a BIP 8 Speedy Trial deployment in Core but won't be if Core uses a mix of MTP and block height. Not only has the PR author's insistence on using a mix of block height and MTP wasted a huge amount of time for all of us but it also now threatens a possible split network if Core activates and the alternative client doesn't or vice versa (due to block height, MTP differences). Although this risk is small, if you add it to the possible timewarp attack those are two risks that could be avoided by using a consistent use of block height. I'm not a fan of taking risks (however small) with activation because of the stubborn insistence of one individual.\r\n\r\nHaving said that if this gets merged and the Core PR #21377 gets merged in its current form I and everybody else will have to do our best with what we have (including probably setting up a new BIP for Speedy Trial). But I do want everyone to be clear on what risks we are taking and why we are taking them upfront. If reviewers are comfortable despite that (which it sounds like they are as a supermajority) then so be it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Are there other implementations out there that I missed on this listing?\r\n\r\nBear in mind that as a soft-fork with minactivationheight, this would give you until November to release a fully validating client conforming to this spec, and if you don't want to implement the signaling activation logic above, you can wait to release your client until after lock in and be guaranteed at least 3 months for your users to upgrade. Further, as a soft fork, if you don't implement taproot at all you'll still follow the most-work chain (but you'd be SPV on correctness).",

I've already implemented the version bits state machine modifications for `btcd` and plan to update [this PR](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/pull/1700) accordingly. I've been working on the taproot changes for `btcd` in the background (including wallet support in `btcwallet`) and should be finished with them in say a month or so (working on nights and weekends). [We already have basic keyspend stuff working](https://twitter.com/gugol/status/1340757561780432899?s=20), just need to consolidate it all. I think we'll be able to get everything reviewed+tested (likely adding signet support along the way) by November. ",

      "body": "@gmaxwell: I'm not going to express a view on whether this BIP PR should be merged or not. I don't have the experience in these matters to think of arguing with you or @luke-jr. I would say though that shoehorning a new activation BIP (or serious revisions to an existing activation BIP) into soft fork BIP(s) isn't great precedent. Future soft fork authors could do the same with a controversial soft fork BIP (to be clear I don't think Taproot is controversial) and then ACK including a new activation BIP within their soft fork BIP. Obviously they will ACK it because they want their soft fork to activate. \r\n\r\nIs it important this is merged? Bitcoin Core is going forward with Speedy Trial (mix of MTP and block height) regardless from my understanding. I don't think it is waiting for this BIP PR to be merged?",

      "body": "@gmaxwell I have similar thinking to Michael. Regardless of how things have previously worked, I think revising or creating deployment BIPs in the same proposal as feature deployments themselves is not ideal. A better process would be to separate those concerns and develop deployment protocols separately from feature deployments that use them. It would be ideal for the community to settle on a particular deployment BIP (or set of deployment BIPs) that consensus  says is/are acceptable, and then when we need to do a feature deployment, the process would be to simply pick from one of those existing finalized deployment protocols. That would allow feature deployments to move forward faster, as there would need to be no argument about how to deploy (beyond simply which existing deployment protocol to select), related improvements could be worked on without blocking any feature deployments, and changes to deployment protocols would have the benefit of a lot more review time to ensure they don't have design flaws, \r\n\r\nAre there reasons I'm not thinking of that we wouldn't want to do it that way?

      "body": "It sounds you me like you both may misunderstand the BIP process and purpose.  BIPs are much more descriptive than prescriptive.  No one can be required to run anything in the ecosystem, so what the BIP represents is some proposal which the authors recommend or which the authors themselves are running and which you might need to understand to interoperate with them.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of junk BIPs-- ones that propose ill-advised or outright broken things, and a large number of ones that no one has ever actually deployed.  This is fine, the BIP process doesn't tell you if a spec is good or not.  It just tells you what it is, provides a basic presentation framework, and a method of distribution where the ones actually need ed \r\n\r\nI think that all that not allowing drafts to be updated would accomplish would be just holding off on them until the thing they are describing is already deployed and entrenched and would presumably move development of their content to another venue until that point, which would reduce the potential for input and collaboration if it had any effect.\r\n\r\nAs far as separating deployment: I'm think that would generally have negative value, because a proposal without deployment does nothing and a consensus proposal with incompatible deployment is incompatible regardless of the rest.  Bitcoin isn't Mr. Potatohead, except in specific cases you can't just mix and match parts and expect working results.  For document management reasons it can make sense to split a proposal into multiple documents but generally there should be a top level document that incorporates the sub-documents by reference-- they're not freestanding proposals.  For activation in particular there will always be specific owing to the fact that each thing starts activation at a different time, but also potentially differences in their trade-offs based on the sort of demand for or impact of the specific change.  Of course, if you don't agree with how the authors have split things up you can work it out with them or make your own proposal(s).  ---- though whole this discussion is pretty far afield of on-topic here.\r\n",

The deployment info would then just be activation params of this new BIP, which were set [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21686)\r\n\r\nI don't see any reason why this can't happen after activation though (since the emphasis is on \"speedy\").",

Would you consider giving someone else merge access in addition to yours so they can perform simple duties like   merging 1104? \r\n <luke-jr> harding: maybe. I'll have to think about it;.\r\n <harding> luke-jr: are you deliberately stalling?\r\n <luke-jr> nope\r\n <luke-jr> last time I wanted to add another BIP editor, I was met with unexpected objections, so it's not as trivial as it might seem\r\n <jeremyrubin> can you set a deadline for doing this one? \r\n <michaelfolkson> It is a touch complicated if there is disagreement on what the parameters are and what activation BIP is being used. Clearly Core and the BIP authors      area in agreement on what the parameters are\r\n <luke-jr> at the same time, BIP10x didn't have any sort of community support either\r\n <michaelfolkson> I think it would be top priority if it was holding up Core progress. But I don't think it is holding up Core. It is just a (very) nice to have\r\n <luke-jr> harding: what's the rush anyway?\r\n <harding> luke-jr: in my personal case, I would like to report that the parameters have been added to BIP341 in the same weekly Optech newsletter where I report about      them being merged into Bitcoin Core.\r\n <luke-jr> I see. When is that? \r\n <michaelfolkson> luke-jr: Optech goes out Wed but obviously needs to be drafted before that\r\n <harding> luke-jr: Newsletter is published Wednesday; I plan to finish writing the draft today.  Here's our regular writing and publication schedule: https://gist.github.  com/harding/0dffdde00761262ca094219c33b8ff22\r\n```",

      "body": "@gmaxwell:\r\n\r\n> I think that all that not allowing drafts to be updated would accomplish would be just holding off on them until the thing they are describing is already deployed and entrenched and would presumably move development of their content to another venue until that point, which would reduce the potential for input and collaboration if it had any effect.\r\n\r\nI don't think anyone here is proposing draft BIPs shouldn't be updated with the agreement of the BIP authors. The problem is the extent to which what should be a new activation BIP (Speedy Trial, mix of MTP and block height) with its own BIP number is instead shoehorned into the soft fork BIPs.\r\n\r\n> As far as separating deployment: I'm think that would generally have negative value, because a proposal without deployment does nothing and a consensus proposal with incompatible deployment is incompatible regardless of the rest. Bitcoin isn't Mr. Potatohead, except in specific cases you can't just mix and match parts and expect working results. For document management reasons it can make sense to split a proposal into multiple documents but generally there should be a top level document that incorporates the sub-documents by reference-- they're not freestanding proposals. For activation in particular there will always be specific owing to the fact that each thing starts activation at a different time, but also potentially differences in their trade-offs based on the sort of demand for or impact of the specific change.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing wrong with a soft fork BIP stating that it is using BIP 9 with these specific parameters. Or that it is using BIP 8 with these specific parameters. That is clearly what has happened in the past and should continue to happen in the future. That is different however to using the equivalent of a new activation BIP, skipping the new activation BIP step and just including it within the soft fork BIP instead. That is **not** what should happen in the future even if it happened in the past.\r\n\r\n> Of course, if you don't agree with how the authors have split things up you can work it out with them or make your own proposal(s). ---- though whole this discussion is pretty far afield of on-topic here.\r\n\r\nThe alternative parameters in [Bitcoin Core 0.21.0-based Taproot Client](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018790.html) (using block height consistently) use BIP 8 as it currently stands. There is no need to revise a BIP or set up a new BIP for the alternative parameters. This is one of the multiple reasons why I and others argued for using block height consistently.\r\n\r\n> E.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki#Deployment and https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki#Deployment which was set by #359\r\n\r\nThanks for these links. This is context that I'm missing and why I'm not taking a view on whether this should be merged or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This PR is not blocking progress for Core or the alternative release and I'd request individuals don't continue to pressure for a fast merge.\r\n\r\nIf the BIP 341 authors (@sipa, @jonasnick, @ajtowns) would weigh in on whether they would ACK or NACK (or have no opinion) including the parameters of the alternative release \"Bitcoin Core 0.21.0-based Taproot Client\" that would be helpful. They are the same as Bitcoin Core's other than `starttime` and `timeout` are defined in block height rather than MTP. In the vast majority of cases these should be equivalent but it is theoretically possible that they aren't equivalent. The alternative release also uses BIP 8 rather than an undetermined BIP number in Bitcoin Core's case.",

I guess we have consensus then ;).\r\n\r\nIf you want BIP8 to somehow informationally apply to deployment for BIP-341, once again I am asking to 1) merge this first 2) make a separate PR describing the alternative and seek similar acknowledgement that this PR has received before merging. \r\n\r\nAs it stands and without reference to anything else this PR accurately describes the code available in Bitcoin Core and has been widely ACK'd so it is sticking one's head in the sand whilst claiming the sky isn't blue not to proceed.\r\n\r\nWe've eclipsed @harding's request of merge before this week's OpTech, and the start time is 3 days away, and signalling 10.\r\n\r\nWhat goal is it furthering to continue to delay here? Whose agenda is it serving? Feigning neutrality while continuing to instigate tired arguments on this BIP is not a neutral stance. What's stopping you from opening a PR to the BIP describing the UASF parameters?",

Understandably so, as the current situation is surprising to me, but perhaps such a loophole is *not* surprising to BIP-0002's author, who is also the current BIP Editor.\r\n\r\nedit: in any case, this seems like a separate issue from the fact that #1104 is RTM, perhaps this discussion should take place on the mailing list or as a PR to BIP-0002",

      "body": "@JeremyRubin:\r\n\r\n> Yes, I'm merely responding to @michaelfolkson's claim that \"If you wouldn't pressurize Bitcoin Core maintainers for quick merges please don't do it to BIP maintainers either.\"\r\n\r\nThat isn't a claim. That is a strong request that if you wouldn't do one please don't do the other.\r\n\r\nIt looks like a new BIP maintainer (@kallewoof) has been [proposed](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018835.html) to the mailing list so hopefully he can take a look at this if Luke doesn't look at this in the meantime. Please do not make a habit of calling for a new maintainer every time you disagree with a merge decision or the timeliness of a merge.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of @kallewoof (or whoever the new BIP maintainer is) this has ACKs from all the BIP 341 authors and according to existing BIP processes this should be merged. It is complicated by the existence of an alternative [release](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-April/018790.html) (Bitcoin Core 0.21.0-based Taproot Client) which is using BIP 8 and consistent block height rather than no existing activation BIP and a mixture of MTP and block height (Bitcoin Core). But as I said since the BIP 341 authors have all ACKed the parameters in this BIP 341 PR then according to existing BIP processes this should be merged as is.\r\n\r\nedit: s/if/since as @gmaxwell suggestion below. No deliberate intent from me on that wording.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "@viaj3ro: \r\n\r\nAgreed. If @kallewoof becomes a BIP maintainer and merges this then this PR situation is resolved. If @gmaxwell has a broader concern about @luke-jr in general in his capacity as a BIP maintainer then he should outline his concerns in detail on the bitcoin-dev mailing list. Personally I think asking someone to merge in activation parameters into a BIP that are not identical to the activation parameters that are being used in an alternative release that @luke-jr is contributing to is not fair to @luke-jr.\r\n\r\nEither it is important this PR is merged speedily or it isn't important this PR is merged speedily. \r\n\r\nIf it is the former, then merging in activation parameters must somehow convey some significance in \"finalizing\" what the activation parameters are. If this is true then I am not sure the BIP authors should decide what the finalized activation parameters and what activation BIP is used. I'd rather there was a separation of concerns and BIP authors weren't deciding how their own soft fork BIP is activated.\r\n\r\nIf it is the latter, I don't know why anyone is putting pressure on Luke to merge this speedily. It doesn't matter and is entirely insignificant. Before attacking Luke they should probably reexamine their own logic.\r\n\r\n",

If I squint and consider that you're saying that you're not saying that-- then I can see the difference but it's subtle. It would be easier to distinguish your position from Luke's if you would lead by example and distinguish your positions clearly yourself.\r\n\r\nYou could start by actually arguing your positions on their own merits instead of constantly argument-from-authority channeling luke, especially when arguing with people like Pieter who has absurdly more experience and authority on this subject matter. ... or other contributors who, on investigation, have actually been opposing your position.\r\n",

To say there's no consensus on BIP 8 is frankly ridiculous\r\n\r\n> 2021-04-19.log:13:47 <@michaelfolkson> Staying quiet as consensus over BIP 8 emerged in meetings is strange to me\r\n\r\n> 2021-04-20.log:04:43 <@michaelfolkson> viaj3ro: \"clearly no consensus\" This is at best disputed. The community meetings in February had near universal support of using BIP 8\r\n\r\n> 2021-04-20.log:09:49 <@michaelfolkson> This BIP 8 not having consensus thing... I understand what they are trying to do lol. But it is nonsense.\r\n\r\nAll of these were defending against the argument that consensus around BIP 8 in earlier community meetings somehow dissipated afterwards. I have said on multiple occasions that Speedy Trial garnered more community consensus than either BIP 8(LOT=false) or BIP 8(LOT=true). The slightly inferior MTP, undefined BIP Speedy Trial didn't result in the community withdrawing their support for Speedy Trial either. But there was no reason not to use consistent block height and allow Speedy Trial to fit neatly into BIP 8 in my view. Community support for BIP 8 never dissipated.\r\n\r\n> You could start by actually arguing your positions on their own merits instead of constantly argument-from-authority channeling luke, especially when arguing with people like Pieter who has absurdly more experience and authority on this subject matter. ... or other contributors who, on investigation, have actually been opposing your position.\r\n\r\nI am not going to pit Luke against Pieter on soft fork activation experience and authority. I have no idea what Pieter's view is on revised BIP 8, UASF for example. I do know Pieter has stayed out the activation discussion for months (wisely in my view). But whoever it is, I make no excuse for channeling Luke, Pieter, yourself, Rusty or whoever else who has been thinking about these topics for many years more than I have.\r\n\r\n",

Constructing such transactions is tricky, especially given the dust limit and doing proper fee estimation, but once you get the details right it works well, and the fact that such transactions are otherwise normal Bitcoin transactions means that existing bitcoin infrastructure can be leveraged.\r\n\r\nSince we've been using ordinal numbers in production and getting some users of the software it seemed appropriate to request a BIP number.\r\n\r\nI've never applied for a BIP number before, so definitely let me know if anything should be changed or can be improved!",
