My initial thought was that it might be better to not rely on state outside the sendcmpct message (but I'm not sure, maybe for segwit this is appropriate) -- but regardless I think it'd be helpful to at least spell out more exactly in the BIP what the intended protocol here is.\n",

      "body": "I have one more observation, aside from what I mentioned above regarding the strict ordering of version messages.\n\nBIP 152 isn't clear on how getdata messages for MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK should be handled if the peer requesting the compact block hasn't sent us a sendcmpct message.  The BIP prohibits requesting a compact block before receiving a sendcmpct, but there's no similar prohibition in the other direction.  However, if your peer hasn't sent you a sendcmpct, then you don't know what version to use for the response.\n\nThe natural thing to do would be to fall through to the next requirement in the BIP, which is that if you don't respond with a compact block, then you must respond with a block.  However post-segwit, there's no mechanism to figure out whether the block should be with or without witness.\n\nI propose that the BIP be updated to indicate that nodes either SHOULD or MUST not respond to a getdata(MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK) if the requestor never sent a sendcmpct message to begin with (as there's no way to know what version to use).  I think then it should be pretty safe for the fallback-to-sending-a-block code to also use the information from the negotiated compact block version to determine whether to include witnesses.\n\n@TheBlueMatt @sipa Thoughts?\n",

It is hard to read into it exactly what version of compact block will be sent to you in response to your request for a compact block. We could tie the two together explicitly and make clear that you shouldnt request compact blocks until you have both send your own sendcmpct and received one, at which point you know that the version they will be sending you is the version you requested last which they also had in one of their sendcmpct messages. Otherwise we need a way to tell the two cmpctblock messages apart (could use a different message name, or a different encoding).\n",

      "body": "@TheBlueMatt Yes, I was realizing that too. I don't think it's a problem at this point, but it complicates reasoning a bit.\n\nRight now, there are two ways through which the sending of compact blocks is requested: one through the bool in the `sendcmpct` and the other is through a `getdata CMPCTBLOCK`. As long as you wait until the exchange of version messages has completed before sending either of those, combined with the fact that you send multiple `sendcmpct`s for different versions in increasing order, it's always well defined what is being asked for.\n\nMy suggestion would be to keep things as-is now, but for a future extension, we introduce an explicit `sendcmpctack` with version number, and a third one `sendcmpctdirect` or so to request unsollicited blocks using compact blocks. At that point, it becomes illegal to send a `getdata CMPCTBLOCK` or `sendcmpctdirect` before the `sendcmpct`-`sendcmpctack` completed, and it's always well-defined.\n",

The only change is that priority order is now highest-priority-first instead of highest-priority-last, which simplifies implementation somewhat.\n\nThe last commit changes the protocol entirely, adding a cmpctack message. This has the advantage that you could implement receiving of some version of compactlocks without implementing sending that encoding, as well as simplifying the protocol slightly (instead of having to check if the current protocol version is higher-priority according to your probably-compile-time list of supported version you know which version you're using directly from the ack message) at the expensee of complicating the implementation somewhat (now you have to add support for another message type and special-case version 1). The last commit is definitely not worth it if we dont anticipate adding more than one or so more versions, but might be worth it if we anticipate compact blocks version 4, 5, 6 at some point. I'll bring this up in the IRC meeting later today.\n",

These messages SHOULD be ordered in the order of the priority which the node wishes to receive cmpctblock/blocktxn messages, with the highest-priority version sendcmpct message sent first.\n+# The encoding version used to send a cmpctblock or blocktxn message or to receive a getblocktxn message MUST be the second integer (version number) in the first sendcmpct message received for which a sendcmpct message with the same version number was sent.\n+# Nodes MUST NOT send a sendcmpct message which contains a version number other than the version number which has been negotiated for receiving cmpctblock/blocktxn messages after sending a request for a MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK object, sending a cmpctblock, getblocktxn, blocktxn, or pong message.\n+# As a node must send all sendcmpct messages which contain a novel version announcement before any other compact block-related messages, it is possible to determine which version of compact blocks will be used for each object received.
