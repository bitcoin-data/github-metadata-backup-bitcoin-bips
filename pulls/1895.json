      "body": "> 1. Allow anyone to steal vulnerable coins, benefitting those who reach quantum capability earliest. \r\n\r\n> \"Quantum recovered coins only make everyone else's coins worth less. Think of it as a theft from everyone.\" \r\n\r\n> Think of it as a theft from everyone\r\n\r\nNot necessarily. Operating quantum computers costs a lot. For example no one will run computations if it costs 100M to break 50M worth UTXO. Of course with technological and algorithmic improvements the cost of breaking a key will go down. \r\n\r\nBut as costs go down each quantum-computer owner is faced with dillema, they:\r\n1) either hack the UTXO ASAP pocketing the small difference between value-of-UTXO and cost-to-break-it\r\n2) or wait for further advancement to increase margin profit\r\n\r\nDue to game-theory we can expect quantum-computer-owners to go for option 1. They won't go for option 2, because they don't know if other players will also go for option 2. It introduces race-to-the-bottom dynamics between competing players in which cost-to-break-UTXO approaches value-of-the-UTXO.\r\n\r\nDoes it seem similar to something? Yeah, bitcoin mining in which average-cost-to-mine-one-bitcoin approaches value-of-one-bitcoin.\r\n\r\nQuantum UTXO hacking can be framed as another parallel process of proof-of-work mining, but with the quantum-computers instead of SHA hashing chips. And as such I don't think it is something to deem negative.",

For example no one will run computations if it costs 100M to break 50M worth UTXO.

They won't go for option 2, because they don't know if other players will also go for option 2. It introduces race-to-the-bottom dynamics between competing players in which cost-to-break-UTXO approaches value-of-the-UTXO.\r\n> \r\n> Does it seem similar to something? Yeah, bitcoin mining in which average-cost-to-mine-one-bitcoin approaches value-of-one-bitcoin.\r\n> \r\n> Quantum UTXO hacking can be framed as another parallel process of proof-of-work mining, but with the quantum-computers instead of SHA hashing chips. And as such I don't think it is something to deem negative.\r\n\r\nQuantum sweeping does not generate consensus, it only funds quantum. Quantum computing isn't bad in itself, it will advance material science far beyond what can be done with classical supercomputers. But it's a mess for everyone if it ends up crashing crypto in the process, so it's better to close as much of the surface of attack as possible to make sure we don't end up with wicked incentives.",

It appears to have helped you better understand the approach taken in this proposal. Skimming your draft, the main difference appears to be a slightly altered timeline, as your proposal aims to start restricting spending of non-PQ output types after eight years from an undetermined time zero, and @jlopp’s proposal proposes to do so 3 years after PQ signatures have been deployed without guessing at the timeline for this prior work. Discussing the timeline of this proposal and making alternative suggestions is well within the scope of review for this proposal, so it is unclear what benefit opening a duplicate proposal would provide at this time.\r\n\r\nAs the Bitcoin Developer mailing list is moderated, it might take a moment for your email to go through. Please feel free to open a pull request, if the discussion on the mailing list results in an evolution of your proposal that significantly differs from this proposal to a point where other mailing list participants encourage you to put it up for consideration separately.",

You seem like someone who very much would like to enforce on us the \"spending restriction\".\r\n> \r\n> Quantum computers would need ≥ **1 million physical qubits** and this must be **logical qubits** (error-corrected). We are very-very far from any quantum computer that would pose a threat to Bitcoin.\r\n> \r\n\r\nThis is word salad, the point of distinguishing physical qubits from the logical ones is that they are not the same. It takes 2500 logical qubits to break 256-bit ECDLP, this translates in about 40k to 900k physical qubits. All roadmaps hit that milestone around 2029-2031.\r\n\r\n> Estimates suggest this kind of quantum computers would exist after the year of 2040. So don't need to rush and block transactions now just because you're afraid of imaginary quantum computers.\r\n\r\nYou're making up numbers, this is worthless.",

Such minor edits typically don't warrant attribution.\r\n\r\nBecause \"Armin Sabouri\" is working / worked for your company, promotion for \"CASA\" here seems inappropriate\r\n\r\nSeparately, I'd like to address the BIP author section:\r\nThe current corporate affiliations (including custodial wallet providers) already feel disproportionately represented\r\n\r\nRequest:\r\nPlease keep this space focused on individual contributors rather than corporate entities\r\n\r\nThe BIP repository should prioritize technical merit over commercial visibility.",

What is the delta between this and freezing all quantum vulnerable outputs in terms of vulnerable bitcoins?\n\nIs the mechanism to determine if a transaction is reject, if OP_CHECKSIG appears in the script?\n\nIf someone did a Schnorr CHECKSIG and a PQ signature CHECKSIG_ML, would that be rejected?

This proposal is radically different from any in Bitcoin's history just as the threat posed by quantum computing is radically different from any other threat in Bitcoin's history.  Never before has Bitcoin faced an existential threat to its cryptographic primitives. A successful quantum attack on Bitcoin would result in significant economic disruption and damage across the entire ecosystem. Beyond its impact on price, the ability of miners to provide network security may be significantly impacted. \n+\n+'''Accelerating quantum progress.'''\n+\n+NIST ratified three production-grade PQ signature schemes in 2024; some academic road-maps now estimate a cryptographically-relevant quantum computer as early as 2027-2030, [https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/our%20insights/the%20year%20of%20quantum%20from%20concept%20to%20reality%20in%202025/quantum-monitor-2025.pdf?shouldIndex=false per McKinsey].\n+\n+'''Quantum algorithms are rapidly improving'''\n+\n+The safety envelope is shrinking by dramatic increases in algorithms even if the pace of hardware improvements is slower. Algorithms are [https://security.googleblog.com/2025/05/tracking-cost-of-quantum-factori.html improving up to 20X], lowering the theoretical hardware requirements for breaking classical encryption.\n+\n+'''Bitcoin's exposed public keys.'''\n+\n+Roughly 25% of all bitcoin have revealed a public key on-chain; those UTXOs could be stolen with sufficient quantum power.  \n+\n+'''We may not know the attack is underway.'''\n+\n+Quantum attackers could compute the private key for known public keys then transfer all funds weeks or months later, in a covert bleed to not alert chain watchers. Q-Day may be only known much later if the attack withholds broadcasting transactions in order to postpone revealing their capabilities.\n+\n+'''Private keys become public.'''\n+\n+Assuming that quantum computers are able to maintain their current trajectories and overcome existing engineering obstacles, there is a near certain chance that all P2PK (and other outputs with exposed pubkeys) private keys will be found and used to steal the funds.\n+\n+'''Impossible to know motivations.'''\n+\n+Prior to a quantum attack, it is impossible to know the motivations of the attacker.  An economically motivated attacker will try to remain undetected for as long as possible, while a malicious attacker will attempt to destroy as much value as possible.",

By knowing a private key to secp256k1 point with one-byte x-value, you can go from 60-byte signatures into 40-byte signatures.

Timelocking is better than burning, because then, future adjustments can be made as soft-forks, instead of being hard-forks. Also, in the meantime, people with frozen funds can still make second-layer transactions, protected by quantum proofs, to change on-chain coin ownership, without making any on-chain transactions, for the time when funds will be frozen. And then, the last coin owners could make a valid on-chain transaction, with classical ECDSA signature, and with quantum proof, that the whole chain of quantum signatures is correct.",

It turns quantum security into a private incentive: fail to upgrade and you will certainly lose access to your funds, creating a certainty where none previously existed.\n+\n+'''Phase A''': Disallows sending of any funds to quantum-vulnerable addresses, hastening the adoption of P2QRH address types.\n+\n+'''Phase B''': Renders ECDSA/Schnorr spends invalid, preventing all spending of funds in quantum-vulnerable UTXOs. This is triggered by a well-publicized flag-day roughly five years after activation.\n+\n+'''Phase C''' (optional): Pending further research and demand, a separate BIP proposing a method to allow quantum safe recovery of legacy UTXOs, potentially via ZK proof of possession of a corresponding BIP-39 seed phrase.

      "body": "Legacy UTXOs should be moved in exactly the same way as they are today, to let old nodes understand it, and follow the heaviest chain in a backward-compatible way. New quantum commitments can be stored in the witness space, or some kind of second witness (which I call \"commitment\"). Existing non-quantum nodes should not process any quantum data at all, just like non-Segwit nodes don't know anything about witness space in Segwit transactions. For each and every OP_CHECKSIG call in any existing form, there should be a valid commitment, which would be processed only by upgraded nodes. It would also let some new quantum schemes to compete more fairly with others, because then, the size of the quantum proof is not restricted by the current max block size limit, and can be changed by a future soft-fork, if needed. For example: instead of ```4*legacy+witness```, it could be ```factor*(4*legacy+witness)+commitment```.",
