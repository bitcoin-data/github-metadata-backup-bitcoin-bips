    "body": "Citing from my e-mail to the mailing list, there are some open questions\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does the proposal sufficiently address concerns around resource usage and quadratic hashing?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Miraculously, once we came up with all possible fields that we might consider interesting, we filled exactly 16 spots. There is however one thing that I would have liked to be optionally available and I am unsure of which side to take in the proposal. This is including the TxFieldSelector as part of the hash. Doing so no longer makes the hash only represent the value being hashed, but also the field selector that was used; this would no longer make it possible to proof equality of fields. If a txhash as specified here would ever be used as a signature hash, it would definitely have to be included, but this could be done after the fact if OP_CAT was available. For signature hashes, the hash should ideally be somehow tagged, so we might need OP_CAT, or OP_CATSHA256 or something anyway.\r\n\r\n  - A solution could be to take an additional bit from each of the two \"in/output selector\" bytes, and assign to this bit \"commit to total number of in/outputs\" (instead of having 2 bits for this in the first byte).\r\n    - This would free up 2 bits in the first byte, one of which could be used for including the TxFieldSelector in the hash and the other one could be left free (OP_SUCCESS) to potentially revisit later-on.\r\n    -  This would limit the number of selectable leading in/outputs to 8,191 and the number of individually selectable in/outputs to 32, both of which seem reasonable or maybe even more desirable from a resource usage perspective.\r\n\r\n- [ ] General feedback of how people feel towards a proposal like this, which could either be implemented in a softfork as is, like BIP-119 or be combined in a single softfork with OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK and perhaps OP_CAT, OP_TWEAKADD and/or a hypothetical OP_TX.",

      "body": "Alternatively, but slightly even more complicating the cases, since the first two fields (version, locktime), are not very valuable without anything else (especially since we have `OP_CLTV`), we could introduce four special-cased bytes to mimick other popular SIGHASH modes: 0x00, 0x01, 0x02 and 0x03. Though locktime might be useful with `OP_TX` at some point. So I would argue against that. Mimicking \"regular\" sighashes isn't super useful in the first place because any system that expects to use regular sighashes can use current regular schnorr keys.",

Though the current SUCCESS semantics are \"any OP_SUCCESS opcode occurring in the script means SUCCESS\", but we could have different semantics that allow any opcode internally to trigger \"instant success\", but (1) that are very different semantics and will require entirely different code and (2) it becomes way harder to reason about.\nIIRC, @sanket1729 also noted that such SUCCESS semantics make reasoning about scripts for things like miniscript way harder.\nActually this BIP seems outdated, I have to push a small update. I decided to propose to make the 0x00 special case mean \"ALL\" to make this more ergonomic to use as a sighash together with CSFS. (\"ALL\" isn't valuable as a template check because it contains the prevout scriptPubkey which should contain the hash) Other suggestions welcome.\n\n—Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or unsubscribe.You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.Message ID: ***@***.***>\n",

Though the current SUCCESS semantics are \"any OP_SUCCESS opcode *occurring in the script* means SUCCESS\", but we could have different semantics that allow any opcode internally to trigger \"instant success\", but (1) that are very different semantics and will require entirely different code and (2) it becomes way harder to reason about.\r\n\r\nIIRC, @sanket1729 also noted that such SUCCESS semantics make reasoning about scripts for things like miniscript way harder.\r\n\r\nActually this BIP seems outdated, I have to push a small update. I decided to propose to make the `0x00` special case mean \"ALL\" to make this more ergonomic to use as a sighash together with CSFS. (\"ALL\" isn't valuable as a template check because it contains the prevout scriptPubkey which should contain the hash) Other suggestions welcome.",
