It's incredibly wasteful - we're not writing legal statues... and these changes could help reduce some friction we've had because it's not explicitly written down and people keep doing things like self assign numbers.\n\nWe've been operating with \"dont self assign numbers\" for as long as I can remember. how is that a change of semantics? @gmaxwell has been plagued by people self assigning numbers, it needs to be documented surely: and documented or not, those are the rules we've been operating under.\n\nWhether BIPs are assigned by pestering the BIP maintainer over email/IRC is requested in the body of the pull request is also such a small change it seems bizarre. Additionally, ever since we moved to Github, people have used PRs as a was to do final review (usually smaller nit, but sometimes larger ones). It works because it's more collaborative than the mailing list. Again it's not a change, it's how we have been operating, I am simply documenting the status quo.\n",
