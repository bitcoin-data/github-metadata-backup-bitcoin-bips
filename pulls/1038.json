    "body": "This removes the proprietary and por fields from the PSBT specifications.\r\n\r\nFirst off, at face value they have nothing to do with the operations intrinsically required to finalize a valid transaction from PSBT manipulation.\r\n\r\nMoreover, whatever information content they can provide for non-standard PSBT manipulation, that content could stay in the unknown field without any loss of generality. How to structure and deal with unknown data would be the responsibility of proprietary software or users wanting to provide proof-of-reserve. As long as BIP174 clearly prescribes that unknown data must be kept during PSBT manipulation, that should be enough.\r\n\r\nLet me stress the above point: I have a project where we include proprietary information in the PSBT. Any PSBT software supporting unknown data gently keeps our proprietary information and our proprietary software retrieves that data from serialized PSBT with no problem. There is no need for a PSBT implementation to provide explicit support for proprietary and proof-of-reserves types.\r\n\r\nMy last conclusion is reinforced by the evidence of all PSBT implementations I know of, including bitcoin core and HWI, not implementing proprietary and proof-of-reserve types. There is a high probability that part of BIP174 would be just ignored.",

Without prefix, there would be a need for central registry for vendors to reserve the types to avoid conflicts. With prefixes a vendor can just use a prefix that would be definitely unique. Agreement between vendors is not required, only requirement is to pick the prefix that is not likely to be used by others (like your domain name, or GUID)\r\n\r\n> If your software knows how to manage proprietary data, then it can do it even if it is stored in the unknown field, without bothering that it has been filed as unknown instead of proprietary.\r\n\r\nThe problem is software from different vendors picking the same way to pack proprietary data (which is likely to happen without deconfliction), but using different formats, making their implementations in best case incompatible, and in worst case corrupting each other's data in PSBT.\r\n\r\nIf an implementation does not want to deal with proprietary fields at all, it can just ignore 0xFC type and treat it as unknown.
