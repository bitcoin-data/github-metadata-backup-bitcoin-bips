BIP32 has a set in stone requirement of an HD structure. and B. That this structure is completely valid, and should be validated by BIP43 as a side-note.\n\nI understand some wallets implemented m\\0'\\0\\k already. But that was because there was no specifications.\n\nReinforcing the \"use cases\" as \"This is how BIP32 Hierarchies should be done!\" and then saying in your own BIP \"HD wallets needs defined purposes!\" seems very contradictory to me.\n",

Currently, the only (published) BIP implementing BIP43 is BIP44.\n\nBIP32 in the general case (using all acounts) is overlapping BIP43, so its incompatible. However, when you just use the default account (number 0), there are no overlaps as long as no one implements a BIP43 hierarchy with purpose 0. To prevent that from happening, I'm proposing this PR.
