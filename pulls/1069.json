That said, much lower and you start to hit unlikely-but-unreasonable-risk territory, at least if I recall the numbers presented to me correctly.\n\nI’m not sure why this needs to be a parameter so much as an amount - I worry that defining everything as a “parameter” normalizes ideas that are probably bad ideas - why would anyone ever bother with readiness signaling with activation thresholds materially less than 90%? If there’s material fork risk, might as well go for a flag day and make it explicit.\n\n> On Feb 17, 2021, at 15:59, Luke Dashjr <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> ﻿\n> You can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\n> \n>   https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1069\n> \n> Commit Summary\n> \n> BIP 8: Make threshold a parameter\n> BIP 8: Reduce threshold recommendation to 90%\n> File Changes\n> \n> M bip-0008.mediawiki (4)\n> Patch Links:\n> \n> https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1069.patch\n> https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1069.diff\n> —\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or unsubscribe.\n",

In light of that, 90% doesn't seem too bad while 85% would be quite a bit worse. Defining the threshold as a parameter may help increasing it - depending on the circumstances - to 95% again because that's just safer.\r\n",

      "body": "> why would anyone ever bother with readiness signaling with activation thresholds materially less than 90%?\r\n\r\nI can't envisage a scenario where it should be less than 90 percent personally but we can't tell the future and I think we should lean on flexibility for the consideration of future soft forks. I don't think there is certainty that 90 percent should always be used. A future soft fork may choose to go back up to 95 percent for example.\r\n\r\n> Would it be satisfactory to simply make the 90% recommendation stronger somehow? (Though it already says \"should\"...)\r\n\r\nI think \"should\" and the setting of precedent for future of soft forks is strong enough personally. Without flexibility, future soft fork proposals may merely choose to ditch this BIP and create a new BIP for the purpose of the activation mechanism. I think we should do our best to avoid that necessity. ",
