      "body": "One design choice I made was to eliminate witnesses programs whose length is less than 10 bytes from being addressable by this segwit address scheme.  My reasoning here is that any cryptographic scheme that provides 80-bits of security will require at least 80-bits of data.  That said, all commonly used schemes, such as hashes, and discrete log based crypto all require 160 bits of data to provide 80-bits of security.  I don't think it would be unreasonable to prevent witness programs of length less than 20 bytes from being addressable by this segwit address scheme.  (Alternatively we could add back in support for 6 and 3 byte witness programs if we don't want to restrict insecure schemes from being addressable.)",

          "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nFor certain Bech32 strings,  **deleting** or **inserting** just a **single character** can produce a string that is **still valid** when tested against the reference implementations.\r\n\r\n## Implementations Tested\r\n\r\n* [Haskell reference implementation](https://github.com/sipa/bech32/tree/master/ref/haskell)\r\n* [JavaScript reference implementation](https://github.com/sipa/bech32/tree/master/ref/javascript)\r\n\r\n## Cases\r\n\r\nThere appear to be **two** main cases:\r\n\r\n1. **Insertion**: if a valid Bech32 string has the suffix `p`, inserting a single `q` character immediately before the `p` will produce **another** valid Bech32 string.\r\n\r\n2. **Deletion**: if a valid Bech32 string has the suffix `qp`, removing the `q` character will produce **another** valid Bech32 string.\r\n\r\nThese production rules can apparently be applied _repeatedly_, either by deleting many `q` characters, or by inserting many `q` characters, producing a valid Bech32 string after each step.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nThe string `ii2134hk2xmat79tp` is a valid Bech32 string, with:\r\n* human-readable part `ii2`\r\n* data part `34hk2xm`\r\n* checksum `at79tp`\r\n\r\n### Insertion\r\n\r\nBy inserting one or more `q` characters immediately before the final `p` character, we can produce more strings that are valid Bech32 strings:\r\n\r\n* `ii2134hk2xmat79tqp`\r\n* `ii2134hk2xmat79tqqp`\r\n* `ii2134hk2xmat79tqqqp`\r\n* `ii2134hk2xmat79tqqqqp`\r\n\r\n### Deletion\r\n\r\nConversely, by deleting one or more `q` characters located immediately before a final `p` character, we can go the other way. The following are all valid Bech32 strings:\r\n\r\n* `eyg5bsz1l2mrq5ypl40hqqqp`\r\n* `eyg5bsz1l2mrq5ypl40hqqp`\r\n* `eyg5bsz1l2mrq5ypl40hqp`\r\n* `eyg5bsz1l2mrq5ypl40hp`\r\n\r\n## Outstanding Question\r\n\r\nIt's currently unknown to us whether this is a property of the specification itself, or merely a feature of the reference implementations that we tested.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nWe ran a suite of [property tests](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet/blob/4a07faaa499a082d9281acf4bd4b6339983484c0/lib/bech32/test/Codec/Binary/Bech32Spec.hs#L149) against a [modified version of the reference implementation](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet/blob/4a07faaa499a082d9281acf4bd4b6339983484c0/lib/bech32/src/Codec/Binary/Bech32/Internal.hs), designed to simulate simple user errors such as [omitting a character](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet/blob/4a07faaa499a082d9281acf4bd4b6339983484c0/lib/bech32/test/Codec/Binary/Bech32Spec.hs#L149) from, or [inserting an extra character](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet/blob/4a07faaa499a082d9281acf4bd4b6339983484c0/lib/bech32/test/Codec/Binary/Bech32Spec.hs#L167) into, pseudo-randomly generated Bech32 strings.",

      "body": "I think this sort of change is okay, but I wanted to comment on what I think is a disconnect between consensus rule design and BIP173 design.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention in BIP173 so that common error modes like dropping or adding a character or two would *never* result in funds going off into space, at least to the greatest extent possible.  Even without any knowledge of 'padding flaw' it was my expectation that as new address versions were released their specific length limitations would be back imposed through revisions to BIP173 or additional BIPs, in order to gain the additional protection.  It's just simply much better to be able to say that certain classes of error are impossible rather than saying that they are very unlikely,  especially when very is \"only\" one in a billion-- and not something where it's not even feasible to construct an example.\r\n\r\nFor consensus rules, sure it makes sense to only restrict the part of the input space that you've assigned meaning to... And yes, we generally intended BIP173 to be forward-compatible for new script types.  But that doesn't necessarily mean that BIP173 can't restrict an input even though consensus doesn't currently.  There would be no reason that a length couldn't be restricted but a decade from now allowed ... at least it would only be a 1LOC change to support sending to it.\r\n\r\nAllowing only far-spaced lengths are probably sufficient for the purpose of making likely errors impossible.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately a payload length of 33 bytes is pretty interesting and would probably be the next most wanted length after the currently existing ones. \r\n\r\n@sipa had some other proposal to change the checksum algorithm slightly for lengths other than 20 and 32, which would retain compatibility for existing lengths yet allow all lengths to work.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Thanks for picking this up, @roconnor-blockstream.\n\nMy thinking was slightly different than what you're proposing: namely restricting the existing scheme in BIP173 to just length 20 and 32, and then (either later or at the same time), define a new scheme which is identical except using final xor constant 0x3fffffff instead of 0x1, and using that for other lengths.\n\nI think using a different constant rather than length-prefixing is preferable, as it doesn't unnecessarily lengthen encodings. Doing the length-prefixing implicitly is possible, but doesn't have advantages - I think - over just changing the constant.\n\nSo this would mean there are two schemes - bech32 and bech32m say - and BIP173 (or its replacement) specifies using bech32 for length 20/32 and bech32m for other lengths. But unrelated applications could pick bech32m entirely (because they're new and don't care about the historical legacy), or they could stay at bech32 entirely (because they don't suffer from length variability).\n\nSo I'm not sure it's useful to keep the set of permitted lengths beyond 20/32 - if the above is the ultimate direction we want to go in, it seems preferable that all future lengths use the new scheme, even ones that technically would be safe to remain at bech32.",

      "body": "Based on feedback I received here and elsewhere, I now understand that the issues surrounding `bc1` addresses is far more complicated that I realized.  The information below was gathered from talking with gmaxwell, sipa, and others.\r\n\r\nThere are two questions that I believe need to be resolved before proceeding here:\r\n\r\n1. **Should we relay transactions involving unassigned segwit addresses by default or not?**\r\n\r\nIf transactions are relayed by default then we run the risk of users accidentally using new segwit formats, such as taproot, prior to their activation.  The rules around lock-in vs activation are a little bit subtle and, for example, it is probably easy for users to mistake lock-in for activation.\r\n\r\nHowever if transactions are not relayed by default then wallet developers need to effectively disable support for unassigned segwit formats, lest during a multi-party payment, for example, one output to an unassigned segwit address prevents the entire multi-party payment from being relayed.  Of course, disabling support for unassigned segwit formats brings us back to the situation where every time a new segwit format is activated, it is unusable until wallet developers upgrade their software to support the new address.\r\n\r\nThere may be room for some compromise, where deployed-but-not-activated segwit address are temporarily forbidden from being relayed.  I'm not sure if that is the best of both solutions or the worst of both solutions.\r\n\r\n2. **Should insertion/deletion of 1 (or more?) characters from a valid address always create an invalid address?**\r\n\r\nThe BCH code is designed so that a single character replacement always transforms a valid address to an invalid address, however when it comes to insertions, the checksum can have a 2^-30 chance of remaining valid in many circumstances.  If we develop a replacement for BIP173, there are plausible ways we can enforce that insertions always create invalid addresses at the data part level by requiring some kind of padding to space out the encodings and/or adding length information to the data part, (though insertions of characters into that length field require careful consideration).  Just as proof that a solution can exist, if we put a length field at both the beginning and end of the witness program, then any single character insertion would create an illegal data value, even if the checksum doesn't fail.\r\n\r\nIf we are satisfied with 2^-30 chances of failing to catch insertion errors, using a xor constant `0x3fffffff` in a BIP173 replacement should be all that is need.\r\n\r\nThe answers to these two questions interplay with each other.  For example, if we are not going to relay unallocated segwit addresses by default then we could perhaps postpone worries about character insertions until such time as we create segwit versions of similar but not equal lengths (which tarpoot's design has narrowly avoided by moving from 33-byte witness programs to 32-byte witness programs).\r\n\r\nThe answers to the questions will also affect how we design a BIP173 replacement, and how urgently that replacement needs to be done.  For example, if we are not going to replay unallocated segwit addresses by default then we might as well simply modify BIP173 to recommend that all non-v0 segwit addresses not be supported, and recommend that addresses for taproot only be supported after taproot activation.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to go about resolving these two questions, but we should attempt to resolve them before taproot deployment and activation.",

      "body": "I don't understand why you believe wallet policy and relay policy have to be in lockstep?  Relay policy can't be more strict without creating issues, yes, but wallets can be more strict than relay.\r\n\r\n> Of course, disabling support for unassigned segwit formats brings us back to the situation where every time a new segwit format is activated, it is unusable until wallet developers upgrade their software to support the new address.\r\n\r\nNot all upgrades are the same though.  Adding an allowed version or length (or removing some allowed lengths) from a list is radically less work than some alternatives.\r\n\r\nI think I generally like permitting all things but then when a new version is defined, narrowing it down to what is actually used.  E.g. 33 is allowed for witness version v1 bech32, but then v1 gets deployed and the usage is restricted to make it more sensitive to errors.  This doesn't break the property that it's extremely robust to additional character errors, because you would have to also change the version (e.g. adding a character at the fourth position).\r\n\r\nDon't-relay has other negative effects. For example, there is some scammy ethereum \"distributed wrapped btc\" thing (I don't want to link it because I think it's actually fraud, but I think it makes for a fine example in the abstract)  which is hardcoding a requirement for users to pay to particular scriptpubkey templates specifically to avoid problems caused by users requesting payments to non-standard addresses and breaking rely.  As a result it's going to be the case that v0 ends up baked into some automated system which is effectively unchangeable and then it turns into a huge burden against deploying new functionality in the future.  (I don't think that'll happen in this case, because the whole thing is an and-its-gone scam, but the general structure will occur elsewhere).\r\n\r\nI think:  The network should relay future stuff, clear that if you use it you get to keep the pieces.  Wallets probably shouldn't allow payments to undefined verisons, however, except via warning-guarded or default-off-config-guarded settings.  For automated transaction processing things that are hard to upgrade, HSMs and the like, they should allow them.\r\n\r\n\"Unknown address verision. This address version was not defined at the time of this software's release and has not been tested in this software. You should consider upgrading before using these addresses.
