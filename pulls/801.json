    "body": "As discussed on the mailing list:\r\nhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-June/thread.html#start\r\nSearch the page for the following subject:\r\n`BIP174 extension proposal (Global Type: PSBT_GLOBAL_XPUB_SIGNATURE)`\r\n\r\n- POR_COMMITMENT is also a separate BIP, but the encoding spec is listed here, so I am following suit.\r\n- Maybe there could be a way to offload the encoding descriptions into a \"this key will represent the BIP number\" etc. but for now no such spec exists. I may create a new BIP to cover the usage of this data for wallets to implement a whitelist for output verification.\r\n\r\nHere is the description of the imagined use case:\r\n\r\n1. Securely verify the xpub of the warm / hot wallet.\r\n2. Using the airgap signing tool, sign the xpub with all cold keys.\r\n3. Upload the signature/xpub pairs to the online unsigned transaction\r\ngenerator.\r\n4. Include one keyval pair per coldkey/xpub pairing.\r\n5. When offline signing, if the wallet detects there is a global keyval\r\nXPUB_SIGNATURE with its pubkey in the key, it must verify that all outputs\r\nhave BIP32_DERIVATION and that it can verify the outputs through the\r\nderivation, to the xpub, and to the signature.\r\n\r\nThe 0x01 global xpub entry allows HW wallet to verify change outputs.\r\n\r\nThis 0x02 global xpub signature will allow HW wallet to \"verify\" a whitelisted xpub that it has previously signed. Which is useful if HW wallets create some way for users to exchange xpubs securely. Instead of having to do the secure exchange every time, they would only need to do it once, then refer to the whitelist signature.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of adding some extra data for a label which would also be signed, that way Trezor could say \"Are you sure you want to pay Cindy?\" instead of address verification.\r\n\r\nReducing address reuse is a two pronged motion of encouraging change address rotation (0x01) and encouraging people use new addresses every time (0x02 facilitates features that remove some friction)\r\n\r\nAny comments are welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

All participants will need to agree on the labels, before the signing. The labels can also be used as/include 'serial numbers' or 'epoch words', as a way for xpub revocations - if the signing person sees that the label includes an old serial number or 'epoch word', she will refuse to sign. \r\n\r\n",

I would much rather this be more generic with the use of [miniscript](http://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) and output descriptors, but I suppose that would require miniscript to actually be finalized. That way you could have any arbitrary script for the outputs (or nested within the outputs as p2sh/p2wsh) and be effectively committing to the script directly instead of just the keys.",

      "body": "> checking whether something is change\r\n\r\nJust to clarify... this is not meant just for change. This is meant for a whitelist feature for airgapped / HW wallets to verify addresses so humans don't have to.\r\n\r\n(ie. We send from cold to warm / hot all the time, but in order to make address verification easier we had to designate one address of each warm and hot as \"the deposit address\" even though both warm and hot were HD... since it made human verification of the send-to address easier... the solution we came up with was to have the cold keys sign a message saying \"I trust this xpub in this configuration as our hot wallet\" and before signing our offline signer will verify the signature and will not send unless it can verify the output script is derived from a whitelisted xpub/config... this way our cold -> warm and cold -> hot transactions don't gather in one address like most exchanges do.)\r\n\r\nWe also think if this type of whitelist feature is implemented into wallets like Trezor etc. Exchanges could offer a pairing feature which will give the user a \"deposit xpub\" and their wallet could just save the xpub internally in insecure storage (Dropbox integration in MyTrezor etc) and the HW wallet can verify the xpub each signature.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think this sort of integration will be more successful and less wasteful than other types of pairing (ie BIP47) in the long run.",

      "body": ">  a way to denote pubkey sorting\r\n\r\nfor a simple byte-level-replace template presented above, bip67-style pubkey sorting is not applicable - in the general case, the script can have sorted pubkeys in one place, and some special pubkeys that are not sorted in another place (timelocked keys). To support sorting, the byte-level-replace template need to allow to express the notion of a 'list of pubkeys'. A bit more complicated, but not by much. If a varint after 0x00 is some small number that cannot be the length of xpub  (less than 78, the data length of xpub including version bytes), it can be interpreted as the number of xpubs in a subsequent list. Having xpub lists would mean there's no need for the notion of 'empty data chunks' in the replacement logic that was presented above.",
