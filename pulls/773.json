For more details visit https://atomicloans.io.\n+\n+==Summary==\n+\n+A Hashed Time-Locked Collateral Contract (HTLCC) consists of two scripts that permit a designated party (the \"borrower\") to lock funds on the Bitcoin chain for a specified amount of time as collateral in a debt agreement where the loan principal is denominated in a currency on another blockchain (eg. Ethereum). We denote the blockchain on which the loan principal is issued the principal blockchain.\n+\n+The purpose of each script is to enable the creation of a debt agreement between two parties (the \"borrower\" and the \"lender\"), where the collateral is locked in a P2SH, and can only be spent once the borrower repays the principal and interest in the debt agreement on the principal blockchain. In the case that the borrower does not repay, the borrower or lender can opt for liquidation of the collateral, which will involve the atomic swapping of collateral for the loan currency. In the case that at least one of the two parties don't opt for liquidation, then each party will be entitled to a percentage of the collateral, decided when the funds are initially locked in the P2SH.\n+\n+These funds are locked into two scripts. Refundable Collateral and Seizable Collateral scripts. The funds sent to these scripts represent the percentage of collateral that each party is entitled to in the case that repayment fails, and the parties don't opt for liquidation.\n+\n+The Refundable Collateral script takes the following form:\n+\n+    OP_IF\n+        OP_SIZE OP_PUSHDATA(1) <secret b2 length> OP_EQUALVERIFY [HASHOP] <secret b2> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <borrower pubkey hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG",

In the case that the borrower does not repay, the borrower or lender can opt for liquidation of the collateral, which will involve the atomic swapping of collateral for the loan currency. In the case that at least one of the two parties don't opt for liquidation, then each party will be entitled to a percentage of the collateral, decided when the funds are initially locked in the P2SH.\n+\n+These funds are locked into two scripts.

      "body": "So the purpose of this script is not to ensure that secret b2 length must always be 1, it is actually using the OP_SIZE opcode to check the length of the secret. That pops the length of the secret to the stack, and then pushes secret b2 length to the stack, which is compared with `OP_EQUALVERIFY`. \r\n\r\nExample: The next item on the stack is a secret of length 32 bytes. `OP_SIZE` is called, which pushes `20` to the stack. `<secret b2 length>` is `20`, which pushes `20` to the stack. `OP_EQUALVERIFY` succeeds. \r\n\r\nSo an example of items pushed to the stack would be\r\n```\r\n1. 01\r\n2. 6443b923b04a21839c44c8f5e54c360af7b5a4541f11511584b6e413a358aa80\r\n3. 02dbf5bf2e114c5e778c904cf8569c77cc18bb32df27bd3d3c539d898ea7150f15\r\n4. 3045022100b302c7fb9cab9978df85ab25be7f8705367e8168c3a6c5c40014acca150c1f6d0220776a0a595b3cec56fe5452a272729cc1215b029c61a2f49a8dffc6ddb96a90a6\r\n```\r\nWhere\r\n1. is OPCODE `51` \r\n2. is the secret\r\n3. is the pubkey\r\n4. is the signature\r\n\r\nwithin btcdeb this would look like this\r\n\r\n```\r\nbtcdeb --txin=0100000001899afa569a843d13bb5b1002f1ba1e9122db5ae7a6a8d913d6cb32cad698e85b010000006b483045022100e408b398b2850c8c8130964fbd4c596aa450ecb5e4c063893b1db49847ac9fea02204d35647416be8a9d2a25484361c5d190afdcab3d79673eade297d207a274427b012102068b045421cc93a1100fa8bfbd81d5edb82c70b44f92666742e4edd46af847bbffffffff02a08601000000000017a914536f6b5a66eb7db8d729c30954da27a1ba748f3187a23fd211000000001976a9140bb2fc4ea28987e8138420c07c95c40b3433e48f88ac00000000 --tx=0100000001c23f56ede1d633789055cf3e862ea902e0dd2564d7d98fb77fe781a782d238fb00000000fd8d01483045022100b302c7fb9cab9978df85ab25be7f8705367e8168c3a6c5c40014acca150c1f6d0220776a0a595b3cec56fe5452a272729cc1215b029c61a2f49a8dffc6ddb96a90a6012102dbf5bf2e114c5e778c904cf8569c77cc18bb32df27bd3d3c539d898ea7150f15206443b923b04a21839c44c8f5e54c360af7b5a4541f11511584b6e413a358aa80514cfe6382012088a82028f71373c8b55f533f5620f838b87d3a1311ac55f571dc7f820416ea1350140d8876a914cbc6adb577679303b91eb69d44fa46ba9c367f2f88ac676382012088a82071f2c5b20684aeb4515068cecc22262fc12cc6b5875cd19377c539d48b8cec1c8882012088a820a9294a6754739dc61a0d49d4ec898f41be27cd7c6c42a0c84d7190605848b2ed880431bf785db175522102dbf5bf2e114c5e778c904cf8569c77cc18bb32df27bd3d3c539d898ea7150f152102dbf5bf2e114c5e778c904cf8569c77cc18bb32df27bd3d3c539d898ea7150f1552ae6700b17576a914cbc6adb577679303b91eb69d44fa46ba9c367f2f88ac6868000000000160840100000000001976a914cbc6adb577679303b91eb69d44fa46ba9c367f2f88ac00000000\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know if that makes sense @luke-jr and if this requires more documentation for the BIP",

In the case that the borrower does not repay, the borrower or lender can opt for liquidation of the collateral, which will involve the atomic swapping of collateral for the loan currency.
