    "body": "Bitcoin's energy consumption is growing with its value. Although scaling PoW is necessary to maintain the security of the network, reliance on massive energy consumption has scaling drawbacks and leads to mining centralization. A major consequence of the central role of local electricity cost in mining is that today, most existing and potential participants in the Bitcoin network cannot profitably mine Bitcoin even if they have the capital to invest in mining hardware. From a practical perspective, Bitcoin adoption by companies like Tesla (which recently rescinded its acceptance of Bitcoin as payment) has been hampered by its massive energy consumption and perceived environmental impact.\r\n\r\nWe propose a novel proof-of-work paradigm for Bitcoin--Optical proof-of-work. It is designed to decouple Bitcoin mining from energy and make it feasible outside of regions with low electricity costs. The proposal has been discussed on Bitcoin Dev mailing list https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-May/018951.html.",

Without that delay, it looks like you could build a large number of ASICs operating in parallel around a single photonic unit.  Your requirement for a random oracle (from past blocks) seems necessary in your system and Chia's to provide a salt for the delay function.  It feels like old blocks giving future miners a permission key to mine, forcing them to go through the delay function instead of being able to mine the whole time.\r\n\r\nOur skepticism is about the shortest section in the paper, section 4.1. The evidence either way on the issue is weak. We skeptics assume that as the technology improves, photonics will split the CAPEX and lifetime electrical costs roughly 50-50 like ASICs. There seems to be a basic economic principle at work.  Even cars seem to have a 50-50 split between CAPEX and lifetime fuel.  If it were possible to scale the other way (away from photonics) and use marbles and gravity for digital computing instead of electrons and voltage, I would expect eventually reaching a 50-50 split, not 10x more lifetime_energy per CAPEX as might be expected if photons are going to enable 1/10th lifetime_energy per CAPEX. The competition for rewards in combination with economics seems to negate any increase or decrease in efficiency. \r\n\r\n100% electricity for mining does not work because electricity is plentiful over the short term to any attacker.  But 100% CAPEX is barely distinguishable from PoS.  0% energy means you can't change a single nonce even in photonics due to Landauer's limit, so you have to find another source of randomness to select the block leader in PoS and the CAPEX-heavy Chia.  Your proposal (like Chia) requires prior randomness which makes me wonder if that alone is proof it's leaning away from PoW. It's interesting you also have a necessary time delay like Chia (your A2D and D2A convertors). But there's no proof (as in Chia's) that the delay can be maintained. If the delay is mostly removed, you're back to square one with an ASIC burning through nonces to interact in parallel with a single photonics chip. As miners push for cheaper CAPEX and faster use of the photonics, the A2D and D2A convertors might be a target.  If a 50-50 split is what miners want, I imagine they will find ways to support cheaper photonics with wasteful ASICs.\r\n\r\nFor those interested in how & why the extra randomness is needed, see [this video](https://youtu.be/-URzxEjeBu4?list=PLKCUhIiFc_PfT_9IlARL2LZmXaAIthE_n&t=701).",

Even if there is some way to rig up a miner for oPoW that would be both competitive and 50/50 CAPEX/OPEX, that would not prevent people in regions with expensive electricity from buying miners with 90/10 or 99/1 CAPEX/OPEX splits if they can be produced. We can empirically see that no one is producing low-opex ASICs for SHA256, although there would definitely be demand. As long as oPoW opens this possibility, it will enable competition and that's enough.**\r\n\r\n**Having said that I don't really see why the ratio would settle to whatever is the case for electronics. Photonics is generally low power relative to electronics in its current use case (telecom) and that is just carrying over to computation.**\r\n> \r\n> For those interested in how & why the extra randomness is needed, see [this video](https://youtu.be/-URzxEjeBu4?list=PLKCUhIiFc_PfT_9IlARL2LZmXaAIthE_n&t=701).\r\n\r\n**Thanks for digging into the details btw**",

      "body": "Here's a [link to the optical POW paper](https://assets.pubpub.org/xi9h9rps/01581688887859.pdf) we're discussing.\r\n\r\nI would say \"[forward compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_compatibility)\" when referring to old software being able to work on new data and \"backwards compatibility\" when referring to new software working on old data.  It might be changed to be \"mostly\" forward compatible (but not very secure for old clients) at a cost in electrical waste by requiring the winning nonce that solves oPoW to also solve the regular PoW at 1/10th the oPoW cost.  New nodes would validate both solutions while old nodes just validate the old POW. The nBits and block hash apply to the old POW.  New nodes require the oPoW cost to be 10x the POW cost via a hard-coded conversion factor to tell new nodes what the oPoW target is. It's an estimate that will change with time as the efficiencies of the two POWs diverge.  It can't be corrected without a hard fork.  If oPoW efficiency gets 4x better while POW efficiency gets 2x better, the waste is 20% instead of 10%. A miner would work on both POWs at the same time. If either finds a solution, the nonce is fed to the other. The probability of a nonce winning both POWs in either order like this is 2 * (target/2^256)^2 / 10.  The inverse of this is proportional to the cost to finding a winning solution that rewards & fees finance.  The \"2\" can be beneficially removed by making the POW the 1st stage of the current oPoW. The cost to attack old nodes with just POW is the regular 2^256/target, so they're much less secure. A fork is assured. There would be a wasteful \"classic\" BTC and the new efficient BTC.\r\n\r\nThe only way to be really forward compatible is if the heaviest work in sha256 can be efficiently turned over to photonics. If that happens, there's no need for a BIP.  This is probably more likely in the medium term than quantum solving. \r\n\r\nBy \"what miner's want\" I mean they will sacrifice efficiency to replace CAPEX with OPEX due to the opportunity cost of tying up capital. A 90/10 machine with an equal lifetime sum of direct expenditures on _computation_ (90+10=50+50 if expenses are defined as net \"on computation\")  is _economically_ more expensive than a 50/50 machine due to higher opportunity cost (or interest payments) on the CAPEX. (Amortizing CAPEX costs as in your paper shifts value from computation to interest on debt payments or ignores opportunity loss aka baseline interest rates).  If computes per joule (efficiency) were a constant for a given computing paradigm, the opportunity cost of capital being tied up might affect the ratio only a little (especially with current low interest rates). But the physics of computation causes efficiency to go down as we compute faster for a given CAPEX in a given generation, or as the paradigm improves to lower CAPEX/computation_rate faster than efficiency improves as a result of the economic incentive. In other words, increasing inefficiency costs from pushing Hz higher are offset by increasing computation_rate/CAPEX, so we can choose a lower CAPEX at the expense of electrical OPEX to lower debt interest costs (or opportunity costs if there's no debt). Economics wants and physics enables the ratio to be lowered.   I agree photonics' incredibly low energy use makes it hard to see how this effect applies in oPoW, but the physics of computation seem to enable it if the tech is sufficiently advanced. This might highlight the importance of the A2D delay (it prevents pushing the photonics Hz enough to become less efficient). Advancing the tech under economics pressure should enable the delay/MAC_compute_eff ratio to be lowered in the future (& thereby CAPEX/OPEX decreased).\r\n\r\nPro-photonics comment: the CAPEX/compute_rate in photonics should rapidly go down but since that causes CAPEX depreciation, it keeps security per miner expense at the current low level (as your paper reiterates, prior solid research shows security in BTC is strictly a function of non-repurposeable non-depreciating CAPEX) instead of hurting the electrical savings argument. That OPEX is not waste because it motivates important advancements in an important computation technology like alt POWs have done for GPU technology. \r\n\r\nCommunication is physically the same as computation, so I have to look at your counterexample. The installation cost per equipment cost is a lot higher in telecom so a long lifetime is paramount, biasing it towards CAPEX.  But the shift from copper/silicon to glass/photonics might have kept the same CAPEX/OPEX ratio if my principle applies.  The comparison has to include entire systems, not just silicon and photonics.  Similarly, home computers historically had a much higher CAPEX/OPEX, like 20:1. But the entire system includes the user's time as part of the OPEX.  That may make it look like 1:20, but there's a limit to what the CAPEX can do for a user which is not the case in POW.\r\n\r\n> It's really a stretch to compare the two cases.\r\n\r\nI can only say it's interesting Chia and oPoW both have more CAPEX to save energy, requires an extra piece of prior randomness that POW does not, and they both use a delay to save energy.  The opposite of these 3 things exposes the physics of why they're correlated:  more energy enables more low-entropy generation in less time.  POW requires prior randomness (the previous block hash) as a proof of delay up until the prior block, not a delay during the hashing.  Each hash, as you say, is a delay, but the 2nd randomness POW uses is a nonce, not another prior randomness. It's the result of a very wide and expensive energy-intensive search. I can't say there's a problem with oPoW because it also uses a nonce, but this kind of reasoning makes me wonder if someone smart could see a problem in the combination of using prior randomness on 2 different inputs, and the delay being inside a MAC as opposed to being strictly encased in a PRF like hashing.

Soft forks enable old software to be forward compatible (can read new data). all forks are backwards compatible (can read old data). Not having a precise name for the new software that makes the old software forward compatible seems to be the problem\r\n\r\nFrom 2017:\r\n```\r\njonasschnelli    The sad thing is, it will be another feature that is not downward compatible.\r\nsipa             breaking backward compatibility in major releases is fine\r\nwumpus           don't you mean forwards compatible? backwards compatible means that it \r\n                can use old wallets, which should always be possible\r\njonasschnelli    wumpus: right. My fault.\r\nsipa             backward compatible means that old software can use new wallets\r\nwumpus           huh? I thought the other way around.\r\nsipa             forward compatible is what you normally always have\r\nwumpus           I don't understand it anymore then\r\nsipa             oopz\r\nsipa             maybe i am wrong too\r\nsipa             i will shut up\r\njtimon           all these backwards and forwards compatibility is confusing, ...\r\n```",

We’ll edit the BIP to better address reverse compatibility \r\n  \r\n2. @JeremyRubin I don’t think you can really consider this an ASICBoost-type speed up. There are standard ways to speed up matrix multiplications, it’s an established area of research in complexity theory and 100s of hardware companies are working on it as well for AI, graphics, and so on. The limits are very well established and there is no low hanging fruit like there was for SHA256 when it first became a target for high performance computing due to Bitcoin. \r\n\r\nThe whole argument for optics/analog matrix multiplication is that it’s O(n) not O(n^2 or n^3).\r\n",

      "body": "Hi Jeremy,\r\n\r\nThis is a valid concern. In fact, one can do better if one batches using rectangular matrices instead of square matrices. This way as k gets large the exponent of such perform n^k matrix vector multiplications approaches k+1. In particular, for every eps>0, there is a k such that n^k matrix vector products can be performed in time O(n^{(1+eps)*(k+1)}). (One can derive the best known constants from the table on p.2 here:  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05622.pdf)\r\n\r\nBut all of this is a bit immaterial, because almost all fast matrix multiplication algorithms are completely impractical. The big-Oh is hiding constants so huge that they only give speedups on *incredibly* large inputs. To my knowledge Strassen's algorithm is the only one of practical import. However, I think dimension 64 will still be too small to give advantage over the naive cubic algorithm. (Also, I'm not sure if Strassen's method has any bearing on rectangular matrix multiplication.)\r\n\r\nI believe that proving a lower bound on the complexity of amortized matrix vector multiplication is well beyond our current techniques. The best lower bounds on the complexity of determining if a formula of length n is satisfiable are something like 4n (and the best upper bound is essentially 2^n, try all inputs). One could potentially hope to prove a lower bound on restricted class of algorithms, but its not clear what this would mean here.\r\n\r\n.marshall\r\n\r\n\r\n",
