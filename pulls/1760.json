      "body": "> I am a little surprised at this pull request, given the [frequent coverage](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/consensus-cleanup-soft-fork/) of Antoine’s [ongoing research](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/great-consensus-cleanup-revival/710/5) on reviving the Great Consensus Cleanup that includes a similar fix. It seems better to me to package all four fixes in one soft fork. Was it overlooked that this work is being duplicated, or are you disagreeing with the direction of Antoine’s work and want to put forward an alternative? Could you elaborate why you decided to submit this?\r\n\r\nHI Murch! \r\n\r\n>Great Consensus Cleanup\r\n\r\nWhile the GCC is a great name for a disjoint set of bitcoin protocol security fixes, that doesn't mean they all need to be bundled into one BIP and deployed at the same time.\r\n\r\n>It seems better to me to package all four fixes in one soft fork.\r\n\r\nThis document takes no opinion on how this enhancement is deployed.\r\n\r\nPreviously we have deployed multiple consensus changes in a single soft fork that contained multiple BIPs. The 2017 Segwit soft fork had [BIP141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki), [BIP143](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki). The Taproot soft fork had [BIP341](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki) and [BIP342](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki).\r\n\r\n>Was it overlooked that this work is being duplicated, \r\n\r\nI was recommended that this was a piece of work that was easily to peel off from the rest of GCC and propose a fix for. Its relatively simple and straight forward, and has been known about for a long time.\r\n\r\n> Antoine's on going research.\r\n\r\nI think Antoine's research is great, but just because he is researching the topic doesn't mean he gets to monopolize the vulnerabilities. The 64 byte transaction vulnerability has been known since at least 2012 - yet no one has taken the time to write up a BIP to fix it 😬 . I've put forth the first BIP draft in the 13 years since this vulnerability has been known. I encourage Antoine to write up his proposal (hopefully sooner rather than later) as he doesn't seem to be interested in working with me. \r\n\r\nOther vulnerabilities in GCC have also been known about for a long time - such as worse case block validation time. Antoine has done a lot of novel research there and I think his work product has been excellent on delving. \r\n\r\nThere is plenty of meat left on the GCC bone, this was a small piece I decided to carve off.",

This in turn allows for proving to a Bitcoin light client that a\n+given transaction is in a given block by providing a path through the tree to the\n+transaction. However, Bitcoin’s particular construction of the Merkle tree has\n+several security weaknesses, including at least two forms of block malleability\n+that have an impact on the consensus logic of Bitcoin Core, and an attack on\n+light clients, where an invalid transaction could be ”proven” to appear in a block\n+by doing substantially less work than a SHA256 hash collision would require.\n+This has been prevented by relay policy since 2018<ref>[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11423/commits/7485488e907e236133a016ba7064c89bf9ab6da3 PR #11423 disallows 64 byte transactions in bitcoin core relay]</ref>\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+This BIP disallows bitcoin transactions that are serialized to 64 bytes in length without it's witness.",

Malicious peers can construct consensus valid and invalid 64 byte\n+transactions that have the same serialization as the concatenation of 2 nodes in the merkle tree.\n+\n+Assume we have a valid bitcoin block with 2 transactions in it - T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>1</sub>.\n+The merkle root for this block is H(T<sub>0</sub>||T<sub>1</sub>).\n+A user could find a malicious 64 byte transaction T<sub>m</sub> that serializes to T<sub>0</sub>||T<sub>1</sub>.\n+Next the malicious user relays the block containing the malicious T<sub>m</sub> rather than the\n+valid bitcoin transactions T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>1</sub>.\n+\n+==== Block malleability with consensus INVALID transactions ====\n+\n+The peer receiving the malicious block marks the block as invalid as T<sub>m</sub> \n+is not a valid transaction according to network consensus rules.\n+Other peers on the network receive the valid block containing T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>1</sub>\n+add the block to their blockchain. Peers that receive the invalid block before the valid block\n+will never come to consensus with their peers due to the malicious user finding a collision\n+within the block's merkle root. Finding this collision approximately 22 bits worth of work<ref>[https://github.com/Christewart/bips/blob/2024-12-20-64bytetxs/bip-XXXX/2-BitcoinMerkle.pdf to produce a block that has a Merkle\n+root which is a hash of a 64-byte quantity that deserializes validly, it’s enough\n+to just do 8 bits of work to find a workable coinbase (which will hash to the first\n+32 bytes), plus another ≈22 bits of work ((1/5) ∗224, so slightly less) to find\n+a workable second transaction which will hash to the second 32 bytes) – a very\n+small amount of computation.]</ref>\n+\n+This attack vector was fixed in 0.6.2<ref>[https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2012-05-14-dos#risks CVE-2012-2459]</ref>, re-introduced in 0.13.x<ref>[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7225 #7225]</ref> and patched again in\n+0.14<ref>[https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9765 #9765]</ref> of bitcoin core.\n+\n+==== Block malleability with consensus VALID transactions ====\n+\n+Producing a valid bitcoin transaction T<sub>m</sub> that adheres to network consesnsus\n+rules requires 224 bits of work<ref>[https://github.com/Christewart/bips/blob/2024-12-20-64bytetxs/bip-XXXX/2-BitcoinMerkle.pdf Note that the first transaction in a block must be a coinbase, and as discussed\n+above, that largely constrains the first 32 bytes of the first transaction: only\n+the 4 version bytes are unconstrained. So it would take at least 28*8= 224 bits\n+of work to find the first node in a given row of the tree that would match the\n+first half of a coinbase, in addition to the amount of work required to grind the\n+second half of the transaction to something meaningful (which is much easier –\n+only 16 bytes or so are constrained, so approximately 128 bits of work to find a collision). Of course, any of the rows in the Merkle tree could be used, but it nevertheless seems clear that this should be computationally infeasible.]</ref>.\n+This is computationally and financially expensive but theoretically possible. This can lead to a persistent chain split on the network.\n+\n+=== Attack on SPV clients ===\n+\n+BIP37<ref>[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki BIP37]</ref>provides a partial merkle tree format<ref>[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki#user-content-Partial_Merkle_branch_format Partial Merkle Tree Format]</ref>\n+that allows you to verify your bitcoin transaction is included in a merkle root embedded in a bitcoin block header.\n+Notably this format does not commit to the height of the merkle tree.\n+\n+Suppose a (valid) 64-byte transaction T is included in a block with the property that the second 32 bytes (which\n+are less constrained than the first 32 bytes) are constructed so that they collide\n+with the hash of some other fake, invalid transaction F. The attacker can fool the SPV client into believing that F\n+was included in a bitcoin block rather than T with 81 bits<ref>[https://github.com/Christewart/bips/blob/2024-12-20-64bytetxs/bip-XXXX/2-BitcoinMerkle.pdf An attacker who can do 81 bits of work (followed by another 40 bits of work, to\n+construct the funding transaction whose coins will be spent by this one) is able\n+to fool an SPV client in this way.]</ref> of work. This also reduces implementation complexity of SPV wallets<ref>[https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/great-consensus-cleanup-revival/710/43 The steps needed to make sure a merkle proof for a transaction is secure.]</ref>.\n+\n+This could be mitigated by knowing the depth of the merkle tree. Requiring SPV clients to request both the coinbase transaction could mitigate this attack.\n+To produce a valid coinbase transaction at the same depth that our fake transaction F occurs at would require 224 bits of work.\n+As mentioned above, this is computionally and financially expensive, but theoretically possible.\n+\n+==Backward compatibility==\n+\n+There have been 5 64 byte transactions that have occcurred in the bitcoin blockchain as of this",
