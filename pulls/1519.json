HMAC is not used at all in the PKDF part of the spec.\r\n\r\nInstead, it should just say 'SHA512', which is correct.\r\n\r\nI had to do a double-take when reading because BIP0032 does use an HMAC-SHA512 method, however I have confirmed with multiple implementations of this spec that everyone uses SHA512, not HMAC-SHA512.",
