The lack of a delegatable structure has also arisen as an issue with other wallet encoding formats.\n\nI'm afraid that I couldn't recommend this design as a best practice.

Attacker would need to take this root node, descend to a node which contains possible address and look into a blockchain if it has been used already. The last operation is much more complicated than using higher PBKDF2 iteration count or  using scrypt instead of PBKDF2.\n\nMoreover user can send various small amounts of bitcoins to fake passphrases in order to confuse a possible attacker and protect the intended passphrase.\n",

      "body": "@slush0 At some point the design changed, originally an application _could_ reject user formed \"brainwallet\" strings, under the revised design this isn't possible because the proposal now consists of a completely independent \"brainwallet\" scheme with no constraints at all on the string. Because of this I can't see how you're arguing this is \"purely a problem of dialogs in the application\".\n\nAs it stands there is no advice to include such dialogs, much less any instruction about required to  do so, any considerations in the design to make doing so easy, or even any acknowledgement that a concern and a solution even exist.  Effectively your response is telling me that to make the proposal safe an implementer must undertake a number of additional steps which are not even hinted at in the proposal. I hope you can see why I consider this concerning.\n\n\"We rushed ahead and deployed this in applications\" is absolutely not a reason to endorse a BIP as accepted that has a flawed security model which _will_— as has been amply been demonstrated by the catastrophe of \"brain wallets\"— put users funds at risk.\n\nIf the proposal was revised (reverted!) to include a specification for decoding and checking the strings and mandating that conforming implementations perform this check and at least warn the user as you describe I would still consider this an mildly unfortunate conclusion— as we already know that users risk assessment on brainwallets is usually miscalibrated— but far better and no longer reprehensible. This could maintain compatibility with \"plausible denyablility\" schemes by only applying the test to the (say) first 128 bits worth of input.\n",

Obviously it is not possible to satisfy everybody, but as you see, the draft is implemented by independent teams in other software, so it's not that _I_ rushed anything. The fact that you didn't follow discussion on topic is not my fault.\n",

If they're willing to calculate the checksum by hand and still not use a good random generator, we can't help them.\n\nI'll also reiterate my previous suggestion to include the trezor's wordlist as a recommended default right in the BIP itself. While I understand you're trying to accomodate the desire for other wordlists, there's no harm in at least saying \"use this one for maximum compatibility\". Hopefully most/all wallets will support it.\n",

I expect that even on a hardware constrained device like the Trezor this would be a much larger value, maybe in the 10k range. Additionally, it is something which could be compactly encoded in the mnemonic itself (e.g. by storing the base-2 logarithm minus the minimum). This would future-proof the standard against future hardware advances.\n\nThe lack of a details of checksum validation is a non-starter. If I were creating or curating a wallet app, I would not allow creation/exports of private keys using this BIP. Users must have a simple, offline mechanism for checking that the validity of a remembered private key, especially if this is being recommended for brainwallet use.\n\nIt is trivially easy to create two UTF-8 strings which are semantically identical but hash differently. With Trezor you control the input stack, but other wallet developers are left up to the whims of the operating system / user software. This will become a problem for users whose localized wordlists involve compatibility characters: is é U+00E9 or U+0065 U+0301? Both are valid Unicode, both hash differently, and both look identical to user. There is a solution to this problem almost as old as Unicode: normalized forms of Unicode standard annex 15 (http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/). Why are you not first converting to a normalized form before hashing?\n",

It should be set as high as possible without introducing unacceptable delay in the user interface.\n\nIf the entropy is bad, you've already lost. These aren't password hashes, they're meant to be a way to crunch a high-entropy string back into a fixed size seed. Honestly, it might as well be a single SHA256 call, to make people understand that it's not secure when used with user-chosen strings.\n\n> Users must have a simple, offline mechanism for checking that the validity of a remembered private key\n\nThey do, as long as the implementation they use to check it suppports the same word list. The one advantage of this over the original bidirectional mapping technique is that once I've written down my mnenomic, and I've verified that it is correct (using the checksum), I can import that passphrase into any future wallet that supports BIP39, even as they migrate to other wordlists or longer strings.\n\n> This will become a problem for users whose localized wordlists involve compatibility characters: is é U+00E9 or U+0065 U+0301\n\nAssuming a wallet developer does use a custom word list with unicode characters, can't the list itself define the canonical representation of the word? It won't save you when the importing wallet doesn't support the word list, of course, but that's a given.\n\nIt seems like everyone is fixating on the fact that this BIP allows for unsafe implementations to still technically be compliant. Yet when the stricter original proposal was written, it was impossible to get wallet developers to agree to implement it.\n\nMy concern is not whether wallets with terrible security practices can call themselves \"bip39 compliant\" or not. All I want to make sure of is that someone writing a new wallet, reading the proposal, can write a secure implementation without having to read between the lines.\n",

      "body": "::sigh:: the slow KDF is the reason for delegatable designs, but I'm certainly not about to argue that you should have that kind of major redesign. I should have called out delegation very early... but when there was ~no risk of brainwallet use there wasn't really a need for a KDF at all except for standard good practice and to make adhoc manual threshold encryption by splitting up the key more secure.\n\nThe constraints on trezor performance make it infeasible to make any user produced entropy reasonably secure, so I suspect the focus should be on the minor improvements necessary to make that kind of misuse unlikely. \n\nAs far as the language goes, I think thats probably the right direction but inadequate detail to actually achieve the good behavior in practice. I feel bad that I've left you feeling like the goalposts are being moved out from under you, and so I'm hoping that some actual (fast) resolution can come from the thoughts being expressed here, and I'm consciously trying to avoid adding more yea/nay while other people are still chiming in.\n",

Honestly, it might as well be a single SHA256 call, to make people understand that it's not secure when used with user-chosen strings.\n\nThen find a way to make the checksum mandatory and fail strings which do not pass. If you don't do that, then human nature being what it is people will use it to construct their own unsafe private keys. And they will have their funds stolen.\n\n> They do, as long as the implementation they use to check it suppports the same word list.\n\nThe word list is not a part of this standard. What you're telling me is that to perform the verification I need to use something implementation-defined. That's very much defeating the point of having a standard, and worrying. I'd much rather there was a universal, wordlist-independent way to check validity.\n\n> It seems like everyone is fixating on the fact that this BIP allows for unsafe implementations to still technically be compliant.\n\nYes, yes we are. Because it is our responsibility to make sure that standards ensure safety.\n\nThe Unicode problem is trivially fixable: mandate that strings are converted into a normalized form before further processing. NFKD is probably the form you'd want, but I'd recommend reading the entire annex and making a determination yourself.\n\nThis is a one-line fix to the standard, and doesn't effect your Trezor implementation at all, assuming you're using an English (ASCII) word list.\n",

      "body": "Given that BIP39 apparently changed from a method of encoding entropy directly, into a KDF + checksum sort of mechanism, I would really like to bring up this earlier proposal of mine again: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=102349.0.\n\nAdvantages:\n- It has a checksum built into the derivation mechanism, which cannot be bypassed.\n- Only requires a word list in generator implementations, not for derivation or checking (so doesn't need to be part of the standard).\n- Supports variable iteration count (in exponential steps), without needing extra bits to encode it.\n- Generating (and attacking) is harder than checking/deriving - you only need to do it once anyway.\n\nTo support low-power hardware such a the Trezor, it would need to support difficulties down to 2^12, I presume, but that's fine. At least we can end up with a standard that in 5 years isn't limited by constraints of low-power hardware that existed at some point in the past.\n\nHere is a proposal:\n- A mnemonic is valid (in combination with a passphrase) if either:\n  - After 64 iterations of HMAC-SHA512, the first 6 bits are zero. The seed in that case is the 63rd iteration's output.\n  - After 128 iterations, the first 7 bits are zero. The seed in that case is the 127th iteration's output.\n  - ...\n  - After 65536 iterations, the first 16 bits are zero. The seed in that case is the 65535th iteration's output.\n- For generation, don't add a checksum directly to the entropy. Instead, iterate several times until entropy is found for which the mnemonic, after 64 steps of HMAC, results in an output which has 6 zero bits (or equivalent for the requested difficulty).\n  - This on average requires 4096 HMAC-SHA512 steps to generate a mnemonic, but only needs 64 to verify/derive.\n\nThoughts?\n",

Every passphrase/mnemonic combination is valid, but you can easily match the generated seed's wallet addresses against the set of unspent outputs to see if it holds some coins.\n\nAdmittedly, the current proposal does make it harder to attack the passphrase (assuming the mnemonic is already known), as it requires EC operations and a UTXO set match to verify. My proposal can be modified to provide the same, by only incorporating the passphrase in an additional final HMAC-SHA512 step. That would remove the 'salt' functionality of the passphrase though, which I'm not sure I like less.\n",

      "body": "Here is how I understand it:  Writing down your key is the only sane thing to do— memory is far more fallible than we credit it for, and keys strong enough to even consider using are fairly long even with friendly encodings. This is all well and good...\n\nBut what happens when your evil maid finds the key?  That would be bad.  So you encrypt it or leave out a word from it or something along those lines.  But what if your evil made holds you at gunpoint?   In this case it would be helpful if an incorrect decryption were still a valid wallet, you could have even sent some funds to it, allowing you to plausably deny having even more funds elsewhere.\n\nIn reality this threat model is a really fringe case, and the sort of thing thats fun to think about in mental games of spy vs spy than something of practical importance.  Transaction graph analysis will almost certainly break it: Maid says \"I know you bought this pack of gum using key XYZ. Key XYZ is not one of the keys generated by this code you gave me, talk or you get the feather duster again!\" Basically your attacker has to be _completely_ ignorant of _all_ transactions made with the denied key, and thats quite easy to break. Plus, if the scheme doesn't have a slow KDF your attacker can brute force out a pretty reasonable space of probable transformations, this is the sort of thing that could just be a standard feature of a wallet recovery tool— let it run a few seconds minutes to try out a million likely related keys... but if you can get the denyability property near costlessly, why not?    Though I don't think the proposal here is getting it costlessly at all right now.\n",

      "body": "There's no reason to leave out a checksum for the sake of plausible deniability - in your evil maid example you can just as easily generate a n word long seed, then extend it by one more word, brute forcing both to be valid. Only write down the first n words and use the first as a wallet for some small amount of funds and hope the attacker accepts it as is.\n\nA second case where plausible deniability is useful is if you get raided by the FBI who is looking for evidence that you've been hiding assets from the IRS. They find a scrap of paper with 10 random words on it, and it turns out those words can access a $100,000 Bitcoin wallet. At the trial, you claim the money isn't yours, they've got the wrong man, and it's just dumb luck that the words matched a wallet with funds in them. Of course, they're not going to believe that once the prosecution brings in an expert witness who points out the probability of 10 random looking words happening to match what someone elses _securely generated_ wallet used was less likely than the judge being simultaneously attacked by a gorilla and tiger escaped from the local zoo.\n\nFor plausible deniability to work, it needs to actually be plausible. You achieve that by making the starting space where you get your seeds from small and unmeasurable. Pass phrases from books or human-generated sentences meet this criteria precisely because the entropy is small, and you can make such poor entropy safe enough by using extremely costly joule-hard KDF's.\n\nFollowing that approach our suspected man would have been smartest to pick a sentence from his diary, or maybe the awful poetry he wrote before he realized that an degree in post-modern literature wasn't going to pay the bills. He then runs that sentence through a KDF with a 360kJ computation cost. (that's kilo-joules, a 100W CPU running for 1 hour) The last part of the KDF process is to brute-force the checksum to produce a BIP39-compatible seed; a small ~256x increase in difficulty. Now when the FBI raids his home they take every single written thing they find and brute force it. Lets say that leads to ten million different passphrases they have to try brute-forcing: 10*10^6 passphrases \\* 360kJ/passphrase = 10GWh or $1,000,000 worth of electricity at $0.1/kWh.\n\nFirst of all, they might just give up, great! But lets say they don't give up: his lawyer can  successfully argue that as everyone knows brainwallets are insecure. The search space of human generated phrases is still small with a high probability of collision, especially when you're willing to spend a million bucks brute forcing every possible combination; it's quite plausible the funds are not owned by his client. Equally, no-one knows how likely such collisions are as it's rare for anyone to spend a million bucks to find out, so it is reasonable to doubt they are uncommon. Because of this, it could very well be theft from an unrelated third party if the FBI took the money, and thus they should leave it. The last argument fails - governments aren't going to turn down free cash - but the jury is bewildered enough to aquit.\n\nNow, back to BIP39... What the above shows is that plausible deniability in the real world has nothing to do with checksums, it is compatible with BIP39 w/ checksums using multiple different ways, and finally as argued before not including checksums in BIP39 is downright irresponsible and will get people hurt due to funds getting lost via typos. From a technical point of view, you can see a 8-bit grinded checksum as a lowest common denominator really; basically any KDF scheme - @sipa's sophisticated grinding scheme included - can be extended to output a seed meeting that criteria using an algorithm where the final step is to simply grind the output further with a counter until the seed matches the checksum. The last decision is how many bits to use; the grinding only needs to happen on seed generation, so again, I ask the Trezor wallet people how long does grinding a 8-bit checksum take? I think for the one-time-use of seed generation, a few seconds is perfectly reasonable, so if we can do more than 8 bits, all the better.\n\nAnyway, if you guys aren't willing to create a standard that's safe to use we shouldn't be willing to put our stamp of approval on it by accepting it. Like it or not, accepting a BIP denotes approval of its contents by the people who control acceptance of pull requests to this repo. That acceptance _will_ looked upon by users as evidence the standard works, represents best practices, and is safe to use. It is immoral for us to put our stamp of approval on something we know is dangerous; whether or not others were foolish enough to implement a bad standard doesn't change that.\n",

      "body": "BIP38 has a checksum; as far as I know it has no serious risks associated with it.\n\nIf BIP39 is not fixed it needs a highly visible warning at the top of the standard that the standard is dangerous, should not be used, is only included to document existing implementations of it, along with a description of why.\n\nGiven fixing the standard is trivial, an approach would be to create a followup BIP42 standard with the fix. Once some wallet software is upgraded, do a user-education campaign. Simultaneously releasing a tool that does brainwallets better would be a good harm reduction measure; PR-wise it'd be useful to get an official sign-off from a well known cryptographer like Adam Back on the design: \"Adam Back agrees: LobotomyKey is the safest way to do something as stupid as using a brainwallet!\" If you're feeling evil, plant some fake reddit sob-stories about people losing their funds because of mis-typed BIP39 mnemonics, with or without associated brainwallet usage.\n\nOr you could just fix things up front and save us all a lot of trouble.\n",

      "body": "> not including checksums in BIP39 is downright irresponsible and will get people hurt due to funds getting lost via typos\n\nThe (wordlist independent) checksums you mention only constitute an integrity check, they have no error correction in them (unless I completely misunderstand them). I'm comparing the various scenarios where people make typos. I have a hard time coming up with a situation where BIP39 as written actually leads to lost funds, while a checksum like you propose doesn't.\n\nIf I make a typo re-entering my mnenomic back from a piece of paper:\n- BIP39 (no shared wordlist): The mistake is only detected once the wallet is opened and found to be empty. The user can retry, and eventually get it right.\n- Independent checksum: The mistake is detected as soon as the user finishes typing.\n- BIP39 (with shared wordlist): The mistake is detected as soon as the user finishes typing. A clever wallet can try to autocorrect common typos.\n\nIf I make a mistake writing my mnenomic to a piece of paper (and I don't check it), then try to restore later:\n- BIP39 (no shared wordlist): The mistake is only detected once the wallet is opened and found to be empty. The user will now have to try and figure out what transcription error they originally made.\n- Independent checksum: The mistake is detected as soon as the user finishes typing. But there's no indication of where the error is. The user will now have to try and figure out what transcription error they originally made.\n- BIP39 (with shared wordlist): The mistake is detected as soon as the user finishes typing. A clever wallet can try to autocorrect common typos. Some of the time that will fix it, other times that will not be sufficient and the user will have to figure things by themselves.\n\nIn both these scenarios, the checksum doesn't do anything more than speed up error detection. The wordlist approach can correct most errors (as well as check the checksum).\n\nThe only scenario I can think of where your approach has a noticeable advantage is:\n- I generate a mnenomic using one tool\n- Write it down (correctly)\n- Put no funds in the associated wallet (in fact I delete all traces from my machine)\n- Import that mnenomic (incorrectly) into another tool (that doesn't support the same wordlist, otherwise it'd catch the typos)\n- Move money into that wallet.\n\nNow my paper backup is correct, but my funds are in a mnenomic that the original wallet wouldn't recognize as valid. It will be extremely hard to find out what my error was.\n\nBut that's an utterly contrived example, do you have a better one? Can anyone else come up with one?\n",

      "body": "@petertodd This discussion is going in wrong direction. However @prusnak's point is that although private keys are safe, they even have checksum, there are still many horror stories of people losing hundreds and thousands bitcoins because they didn't understand concept of change addresses.\n\nSo if you want to think for users, please firstly ban Bitcoin-qt because of a need of periodic backups and ban all bitcoin clients who allow direct handling of private keys, because _all this_ expose common users to significant and _real_ risk of losing money.\n\nBIP39 aims to actually reduce the risk of losing money, because it introduces all that fancy stuff like checksums, plus it completely removes the risk of direct handling of private keys. If you even try to be fair in judging the proposal, you cannot oversee this.\n\nI'm going to change \"Accepted\" to \"Draft\" from the pull request. Please accept the pull request then.\n",

The bad guy getting their hands on a BIP39 mnenomic+password results in you losing your funds all the same, especially considering that the passwords either have to be short enough to be memorable, and thus trivially brute-forcable, or long enough that losing them is in itself a risk.

Our point is that \"current standards\" implemented in all bitcoin clients are much more dangerous for common users, because they let the user handle private keys, do the transaction and silently move change output to another private key! That's something what's absolutely unexpected and what's the total UX fail. Please focus to _these real problems_ of existing infrastructure and care less about theoretical issues where the _real loss_ is neglible, because the _potential use case_ which can lead to losing user's funds is detectable (as is _recommended_ in the paper).\n\nFor me this discussion is nothing more than obstructing the reached consensus of other developers just because of non-realistic scenarios which won't happen in real life.\n",

      "body": "There's a big difference between wallet software letting a user do something by manually getting a private key out via some expert-mode interface and designing a system that deliberately makes it easy, even necessary, to disable safeguards. You're specifically handling UTF-8 so you can avoid having to specify a wordlist in stone, which inevitably means you will see wallet software disable the checking of checksums to allow seeds to be imported between wallets that do not support the same wordlists. The BIP39 standard as written has to have SHOULD instead of MUST because of that. Meanwhile the two actions you can take to fix this problem, specifying a wordlist in stone and removing the UTF8 handling, or using a grinded checksum, you refuse to do; the latter can even be done in a completely backwards compatible way.\n\nSo why is that? I note you still haven't answered my question about whether or not a Trezor can grind a checksum.\n\nAgain, the problem is very simple: user generates mnemonic, user writes down mnemonic as a secure backup, user imports into same or different wallet software with typo. Since the checksum is optional and checksum checking must be able to either be \"clicked through\" or disabled for compatibility we have an opportunity for the backup and wallet to diverge and funds to be lost. Keep in mind that there may be no transactions in the wallet to warn the user something is amiss, they may not realize the lack of transactions/funds represents a problem, or they may be importing into a offline system that can't determine what transactions would be associated with the wallet anyway.\n\nAlso since I'm repeating myself, I'll point out that equally the fact that mistyping a passphrase has the same effect - all passphrases are valid - will result in users losing their funds and in reality reflects a poorly done brainwallet-based design snuck in through the backdoor. (note how passphrases can't be changed) Again, that is solid grounds for NACKing BIP39.\n",

Ok, then we probably won't find a consensus at this point.\n\n\" you refuse to do\" - No, I'm not refusing to do it. Actually I would _love_ to have hardcoded wordlist and don't allow any other method. Unfortunately other developers didn't agree on this point, so we offered this to find an agreement with them.\n\nHonestly, we need to go forward. We've spent almost a year (!!) on theoretical discussions and we've rewritten the proposal many times. Please keep in mind that finding a solution where everybody will be absolutely happy with is _impossible_. I'd like to see you to understand this.\n\nPlease accept the pull request, because your comments are off-topic to current pull request. Let's then discuss deeper changes on mailing list. Again, current pull request simply fixes some minor things of the mechanism which is in the draft already, so there's no reason to block changes in this way.\n\nPlease...\n",

      "body": "Let's not make this into an us-vs-them discussion, and work towards a solution.\n\nFirst, my own opinion:\n\nI think the concern raised here is that you're essentially defining two versions of the standard, and try to get the benefits of both.\n- A wordlistless version that just accepts any UTF-8 string as mnemonic, and produces a seed for each, but which cannot detect any typo.\n- A version with a specific well-defined wordlist, with a checksum.\n  However, if you want to support mnemonics from software without the checksum, you cannot enforce it. This makes it directly usable as human-generated-brainwallet tool, which is something that many people have concerns about.\n\nI think you have to choose one or the other. In practice, either every wallet with implement the dictionary (and we'd have been better off just enforcing it), or they will end up using different wordlists each and all software will just accept anything (and we just have human-generated brainwallets).\n\nRegarding wallets (including Bitcoin-Qt's) current key handling resulting in more problems: very likely. I'm completely with you that we should try to avoid handling private keys directly, avoid requiring constant backups, and avoid exposing users to individual addresses. that's also why I'm working on BIP32 support in it. I'd also like to have _some_ version of paper wallet / mnemonic in it, but only under the condition that it cannot (easily) support human-generated entropy. Ideally, it also has adaptive strengthening, so it doesn't become weaker security-wise over time.\n\nIs a checksum-grinding mechanism really inacceptable to you? It would lower many concerns.\n\nAs a meta-discussion: it is very unclear to me who should be in charge of allowing modifications to the bips repository. It's certainly not the core developers (so please don't see my opinion here as _review_, it's just my opinion), I'd say the same person who assigns BIP ids + original author (or champion who took over)?\n\nIn any case, I don't see why this change cannot be merged, it's certainly an improvement and it represents the current state of the proposal. Whether it is a good proposal, with community consensus, is a different question.\n",
