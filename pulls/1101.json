      "body": "For the record I [disapproved](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21377#issuecomment-791987546) of revising BIP 9 back on March 17th and I'm not exactly impressed today. I can only speak for myself though and not having a BIP (or at least a pull request such as this one) to refer to for the latest state diagram of #21377 of Speedy Trial is not healthy for the review of #21377.\r\n\r\nI think the intention here is to make BIP 9 into a generalized activation BIP (like BIP 8 currently is) with multiple parameters and incorporating multiple activation mechanisms, the only parameter missing of course being the LOT parameter. And using this mix of MTP and block height for Speedy Trial instead of using block height consistently.\r\n\r\nI prefer a new BIP number for Speedy Trial personally if people are going to go to these lengths to avoid using BIP 8. BIP 9 has a lot of history and so it can't be a fresh exclusively Speedy Trial BIP. But then having two flavors of Speedy Trial (BIP 8 and BIP 9 Speedy Trial) is nonsense. Someone will need to explain the differences between BIP 8 and BIP 9 for future soft forks (good luck to whoever tries that). I honestly don't know what some people are doing anymore. The amount of time wasted on this BIP 8 vs BIP 9 and block height vs mix of block height and MTP just appalls me.\r\n\r\nAgain I've said all this on many occasions ([1](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21377#issuecomment-791987546), [2](https://gist.github.com/michaelfolkson/92899f27f1ab30aa2ebee82314f8fe7f#gistcomment-3668053)).\r\n",

      "body": "> the only parameter missing of course being the LOT parameter\r\n\r\nI think BIP 8 is a better place to introduce a more drastic change like LOT. The main thing this PR introduces is a longer LOCKIN phase. The rest is cosmetics.\r\n\r\n> BIP 9 has a lot of history\r\n\r\nYes, but these changes are backwards compatible, as explained in this PR. Since BIP 8 is entirely height based (which I also prefer) implementing it in existing clients is much more involved. The fact that `min_activation_height` makes BIP 9 a weird mix of time and height is easier in the implementation than it might sound.\r\n\r\n> Someone will need to explain the differences between BIP 8 and BIP 9 for future soft forks (good luck to whoever tries that).\r\n\r\nWhy would that be more difficult in the future than it is now? \"We're ditching time based in favor of block based, that's all\" would be the explanation.\r\n\r\n> The amount of time wasted on this BIP 8 vs BIP 9 and block height vs mix of block height and MTP just appalls me.\r\n\r\nI still favor a height based approach, i.e. speedy trial with BIP 8, or just a regular BIP 8 deployment with `LOT=false` (no delayed activation). But given that even the author of the BIP 8 PR switched his effort to BIP 9, the most useful thing for me to do for is just to review and document a BIP 9 speedy trial.\r\n\r\nOne final point: it's still possible to refactor the BIP 9 speedy trial code to a BIP 8 speedy trial. The changes needed to switch from BIP 9 to BIP 8, which have already been coded up, can be mostly reused for that. The use of `min_activation_height` (rather than time) in fact makes that easier.",

And all of csv, segwit and bip 91 did reach the ACTIVE state so even if they weren't considered buried, interpretation shouldn't change.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I'm not convinced there's a need to have this as a separate bip rather than just documenting the delta in the taproot bip directly -- that should only be necessary if we wanted to reuse exactly this activation method again in the future, in which case having a separate bip to refer to would be helpful. That seems pretty unlikely. I have an update to bip341 that documents the activation details drafted at https://github.com/ajtowns/bips/blob/202103-bip341-speedy-trial-mtp/bip-0341.mediawiki#Deployment that I was aiming to PR today, but I would really rather avoid having another set of competing PRs on this topic. LMK if you want to persevere with this or would rather switch to that.\r\n\r\n[EDIT: opened as #1104]",

      "body": "Tend to NACK. Procedurally, BIP 9 is in Final status which implies that it cannot be modified. Additionally, I consider the state machine changes to be a significant change to BIP 9, although the actual code changes themselves are small. Given those two facts, I don't think that we should be modifying BIP 9 itself to include speedy trial. Rather I think that a new BIP should be written which specifies speedy trial, the state machine changes, and the proposed `LAST_CHANCE` state for UASFs. I think that for now, it would be okay to write the speedy trial modifications in BIPs 341/342, but I would prefer that a new document is drafted for the full MTP versionbits methodology that has been proposed. This new document does not need to be a full BIP that describes everything from scratch (like BIP 8 and 9 do) but rather one which refers to BIP 9 and provides additional modifications on top of it (in a similar way to BIP 350 specifying the changes from BIP 173).",

      "body": "I think it's very confusing for anyone trying to implement BIP 9 from scratch to have to look at this BIP and then look in BIP 341 for changes. Most likely they would start with reading this BIP and then look at the Bitcoin Core code, only to find it doesn't match in strange ways.\r\n\r\nAny client that already implements BIP 9 will have to make changes in order to correctly detect the Taproot fork. For them it probably doesn't matter where the info is, but this seems a more natural spot.\r\n\r\nIt seems exceedingly unlikely to me that if we activate Taproot with this, that the next soft fork would use vanilla BIP 9. And it makes no sense in e.g. a ANYPREVOUT softfork to have to point to Taproot documentation. Even if the speedy trial doesn't activate, I doubt we'll revert the changes in Bitcoin Core.\r\n\r\nHence my preference for updating this.\r\n\r\nMy second preferred solution would be a fresh BIP for the activation (rather than mixing it in with Taproot specific stuff).\r\n\r\n",

This uses the \"speedy trial\" approach [0]  with some refinements to the exact mechanism [1], as implemented in bitcoin/bitcoin#21377 . Parameters are selected based on previous discussions [2] [3] [4]. The parameters are:\r\n\r\n* starttime = 2021-04-24 00:00 UTC\r\n* timeout = 2021-08-11 00:00 UTC\r\n* min_activation_height = 709632 (est mid November 2021, mainnet only)\r\n* threshold = 1815 / 2016 blocks (90%, mainnet only)\r\n\r\nIn terms of block heights, that will likely mean the first signalling period for mainnet should start at height 681408, approximately April 29th UTC, and will likely mean signalling will continue for 8 retarget periods until height 697536 (which if blocks arrived at 10 minute intervals, would be due around 2021-08-20).\r\n\r\n[0] https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018583.html\r\n[1] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21377#issuecomment-814494847\r\n[2] (90%) https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018425.html\r\n[3] (May/August/Nov) https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018715.html\r\n[4] (specific parameters) https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1081",

It might be good for such a BIP to also document how activations actually occur for signet in order to test new soft forks.",

      "diff_hunk": "@@ -23,6 +28,11 @@ BIP 34 introduced a mechanism for doing soft-forking changes without a predefine\n \n In addition, BIP 34 made the integer comparison (nVersion >= 2) a consensus rule after its 95% threshold was reached, removing 2<sup>31</sup>+2 values from the set of valid version numbers (all negative numbers, as nVersion is interpreted as a signed integer, as well as 0 and 1). This indicates another downside this approach: every upgrade permanently restricts the set of allowed nVersion field values. This approach was later reused in BIP 66 and BIP 65, which further removed nVersions 2 and 3 as valid options. As will be shown further, this is unnecessary.\n \n+==2021 update==\n+\n+* '''min_activation_height''' was added. Clients unaware of softforks introduced after SegWit can ignore this in the context of their upgrade warnings.\n+* removed state transition from '''defined''' to '''failed'''. This change is safe to ignore for all (burried) softforks deployed before 2021.",
