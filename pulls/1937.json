You could update the specification to announce \"SENDTEMPLATE 2\" indicating you support v2, which indicates to your peers they can send you a \"GETTEMPLATE 2\" message requesting a 2MvB template rather than a 1MvB template, eg.\r\n\r\nLikewise sending set differences through could make sense (and wouldn't need the complexity of minisketch since the sender knows their own previous templates), but there's still a lot of design space left, so getting real-world data also seems useful for resolving that. (Likewise an updated spec could allow `SENDTEMPLATE 2D` to indicate deltas are supported, and `GETTEMPLATE 2 $hash` could request a 2MvB template encoded as a delta against the previous template with hash `$hash`)",

A `template` message may only be sent in response to a `gettemplate`\n+message.\n+3. The `header` hash included in the payload must be a unique hash,\n+and should be the hash of a block made up of those transactions.\n+4. The transactions making up the payload of the template should be valid\n+as a block -- for example all unconfirmed parents of a transaction should be\n+included before the transaction, and consensus limits should be respected.\n+5. A block containing the transactions making up the payload must not\n+exceed four million weight units as defined in [BIP-141][BIP-141].",

So I think it makes more sense to get some experience with the behaviour of things before speccing out best practices or new features for peer discovery. ",

The `template` message is defined as a message with `pchCommand ==\n+\"template\"` and a payload of a serialized `HeaderAndShortIDs` message\n+(see [BIP-152][BIP-152]) containing a recent template.\n+2. A `template` message may only be sent in response to a `gettemplate`\n+message.\n+3. The `header` hash included in the payload must be a unique hash,\n+and should be the hash of a block made up of those transactions.\n+4. The transactions making up the payload of the template should be\n+valid for block inclusion -- for example all unconfirmed parents of a\n+transaction should be included before the transaction, and consensus\n+limits should be respected.\n+5. The cumulative weight of the transactions making up the\n+payload must not exceed eight million weight units as defined in\n+[BIP-141][BIP-141]. Note that this is twice the block weight limit, and\n+does not include the overhead that assembling those transactions into\n+a block would involve (header, coinbase and tx count serialization),\n+so this can be slightly more than two blocks' worth of transactions.\n+6. After sending a `template` message, a node should accept a\n+`sendblocktxns` message that specify the template's `header` hash, and\n+respond with a `blocktxns` message including the appropriate transaction\n+data, exactly as if it had sent a `cmpctblock` message with the same\n+payload as the `template` message. It should be able to provide such\n+transactions for a moderate amount of time after sending a template\n+(eg, five minutes). If it cannot provide a correct `blocktxns` response,\n+it should ignore the request.\n+\n+## Rationale\n+\n+### Protocol design\n+\n+This design closely follows the \"low-bandwidth mode\" specified in\n+[BIP-152][BIP-152], providing a negotiation message, the ability for\n+a peer to request data, and a response encoding the data via shortids.\n+This is designed to be relatively low bandwidth, but importantly also\n+to be simple to implement and deploy in any software that has already\n+implemented compact block relay.\n+\n+### Template size\n+\n+This BIP specifies a maximum template size equivalent to two blocks'\n+worth of transactions. This is chosen so that even if two blocks are\n+mined in quick succession, prior templates that were shared using this\n+protocol are likely to have included the transactions from both blocks.\n+\n+If blocks are found randomly, it is expected that 5% of blocks will\n+be found within 30 seconds of the previous block, which is about 7 per\n+day; so this seems frequent enough to address explicitly. In contrast,\n+the chances of finding two blocks within 30 seconds of a block is only\n+0.12%, so even in ideal circumstances, is only expected to occur about\n+once per week, and thus further optimisation does not seem warranted.\n+\n+### Forward compatibility\n+\n+It is likely that improvements can be made to this design, particularly\n+to further reduce the bandwidth needed for updating templates. This\n+could be achieved by:\n+\n+  * defining a new payload for the `template` message with a new, more\n+    efficient encoding of (changes to) the template data\n+  * adding a payload to the `gettemplate` message so that peers can\n+    indicate they will accept a new encoding of the template\n+  * adding a payload to the `sendtemplate` message to indicate that the\n+    `gettemplate` payload will be accepted\n+\n+## Recommendations",

The `sendtemplate` message is defined as a message with `pchCommand ==\n+\"sendtemplate\"`.\n+2. No payload data should be provided, however, for upgrade purposes,\n+any payload data received should be ignored.\n+3. If a node implements this BIP, it must send the `sendtemplate`\n+message after `version` and before `verack`.\n+\n+### `gettemplate`\n+\n+1. The `gettemplate` message is defined as a message with `pchCommand ==\n+\"gettemplate\"`.\n+2. No payload data should be provided.\n+3. If the node received a `sendtemplate` message, it may send a\n+`gettemplate` message at any time after `verack`, in order\n+to request a new template.\n+3. A `gettemplate` message must not be sent if a `sendtemplate` message\n+was not already received.\n+4. Upon receipt of a `gettemplate` message, a node may reply with a\n+`template` message.\n+\n+### `template`\n+\n+1. The `template` message is defined as a message with `pchCommand ==\n+\"template\"` and a payload of a serialized `HeaderAndShortIDs` message\n+(see [BIP-152][BIP-152]) containing a recent template.\n+2. A `template` message may only be sent in response to a `gettemplate`\n+message.\n+3. The `header` hash included in the payload must be a unique hash,\n+and should be the hash of a block made up of those transactions.\n+4. The transactions making up the payload of the template should be\n+valid for block inclusion -- for example all unconfirmed parents of a\n+transaction should be included before the transaction, and consensus\n+limits should be respected.\n+5. The cumulative weight of the transactions making up the\n+payload must not exceed eight million weight units as defined in\n+[BIP-141][BIP-141]. Note that this is twice the block weight limit, and\n+does not include the overhead that assembling those transactions into\n+a block would involve (header, coinbase and tx count serialization),\n+so this can be slightly more than two blocks' worth of transactions.\n+6. After sending a `template` message, a node should accept a\n+`sendblocktxns` message that specify the template's `header` hash, and\n+respond with a `blocktxns` message including the appropriate transaction\n+data, exactly as if it had sent a `cmpctblock` message with the same\n+payload as the `template` message. It should be able to provide such\n+transactions for a moderate amount of time after sending a template\n+(eg, five minutes). If it cannot provide a correct `blocktxns` response,",
