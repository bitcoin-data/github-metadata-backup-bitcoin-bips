It can be viewed as a codec for [wallet policies](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1389). \r\n\r\nToday, there exists a plethora of formats for exchanging descriptors, all with downsides:\r\n\r\n- Raw xpubs are underspecified (missing script type)\r\n- The BlueWallet textual format is inefficient (base58 xpubs) and doesn't support arbitrary descriptors.\r\n- Raw [BIP-380](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0380.mediawiki) descriptors are also inefficient and lack metadata.\r\n- [BCR-2023-010](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-010-output-descriptor.md) are efficient but rely on the more complex (d)CBOR encoding.\r\n- JSON encoded textual descriptors are also inefficient and require a JSON implementation.\r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses them all:\r\n\r\n- Based on PSBT, signing devices need not spend additional code space on a separate codec.\r\n- Efficient encoding of extended keys.\r\n- Metadata (title, birth block) supported.\r\n- Every current or future bip-380 descriptor can be represented.\r\n\r\n> Also, descriptors are a textual format, and encoding text in binary is just not very efficient. There are better ways to do that if you really wanted to.\r\n\r\nWe believe it's hopeless to keep a binary representation of output descriptors up to date with the moving target that is textual bip-380 descriptors ([BCR-2020-010](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-010-output-desc.md) attempted but failed).

      "body": "BIP 174 PSBTs and Extended Keys: PSBTs, specified in BIP 174, are a format for partially signed Bitcoin transactions, enabling offline signing and multi-party approval workflows. These transactions may contain extended keys for deriving input and output addresses. Extended keys allow for hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets, where multiple addresses can be derived from a single master key.\r\n\r\nIntroduction of Output Script Descriptors: The proposal suggests introducing an additional field in PSBTs to represent arbitrary BIP 380 output script descriptors. Output script descriptors, specified in BIP 380, provide a concise way to describe various types of output scripts. This addition would enhance the flexibility and interoperability of PSBTs, allowing for more complex transaction scripts.\r\n\r\nOptional Unsigned Transaction: Traditionally, PSBTs include the unsigned transaction itself. However, this proposal suggests making the unsigned transaction optional. This change would allow for the transfer of output descriptors outside of the signing process, potentially simplifying certain workflows or reducing data redundancy.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Hardware signing devices need knowledge of the full descriptor/wallet policy in order to:\r\n- recognize change addresses\r\n- recognize from which of your different _accounts_ (sometimes called _wallets_) the inputs are spending from.\r\n\r\n(The second could perhaps be considered a strengthening of the traditional guarantees of hardware signers, not sure if it was ever formalized before wallet policies; I think it's essential in practice for anything that is not single-user)\r\n\r\nWhile it's true that PSBTs today have enough info to _sign_, they do not have enough info to _do it securely_ - the descriptor is also needed. Therefore, I agree that it would be a great improvement to be able to pass this info via PSBTs; currently, the Ledger app's signing flow is `sign(PSBT, wallet_policy)`, and quite some work in the app goes into figuring out `change`/`address_index` for each input and change output based on the derivations in the PSBT.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think that's a separate discussion, and it's unclear that recycling PSBTs for a purpose other than representing transactions brings any benefit over than directly designing a space-efficient encoding specifically for descriptors or wallet policies – if the <30% space saving that can be obtained with a re-encoding is deemed important in practice.",

I've updated the proposal so it's no longer a PSBT extension but a separate format merely based on PSBT key-value maps.\r\n\r\nI'd like to add proof-of-registration (PoR), but I'm not sure how it's best done. There's some discussion at https://github.com/wizardsardine/liana/issues/539#issuecomment-1877372827, where @bigspider suggests a HMAC scheme and in a later post @pythcoiner suggest that the format of PoR field should be vendor defined. I'm still of the position that to be maximally useful and interoperable, the PoR field should have a defined format and be a signature, not a HMAC.",

There's some discussion at [wizardsardine/liana#539 (comment)](https://github.com/wizardsardine/liana/issues/539#issuecomment-1877372827), where @bigspider suggests a HMAC scheme and in a later post @pythcoiner suggest that the format of PoR field should be vendor defined. I'm still of the position that to be maximally useful and interoperable, the PoR field should have a defined format and be a signature, not a HMAC.\r\n\r\nAs i already said in previous discussion, i do not have strong opinion about wether the PoR should be standardized or not, but i do not think it should be standardized in this BIP.\r\n\r\nAnd anyway if i get it well both sheme (HMAC vs Signature) will be 32 bytes of data?\r\n",
