    "body": "by merging it with the version packet. Or more accurately, by merging it with the first packet sent after garbage termination, which may be a decoy packet or the version packet.\r\n\r\nThe new protocol simplifies implementations:\r\n - A protocol state machine won't need separate states for garbage authentication and version phases.\r\n - The special case of \"ignoring the ignore bit\" is removed.\r\n - The freedom to choose the contents of the garbage authentication packet is removed. This simplifies testing.\r\n\r\nThe reason for having a separate garbage authentication packet was to materialize the separation of the key exchange phase and version negotiation phase even in the bytestream on the wire. However, this is not necessary, and arguably, these phases are still properly separated: Since the AEAD will ensure that AAD (=garbage) is checked before looking at the contents (=version), the peers won't interpret version data before having authenticated the garbage.",

      "body": "ACK, though I want to wait for some more opinions - the BIP is fine as is, and I'm not sure whether this minor improvement is worth the breaking change at this point.\n\nFor a bit of history, this was a conscious decision earlier, to separate the garbage phase from the version negotiation phase. But arguably, the result isn't all that consistent either. The idea was to use the \"packet\" interface for everything after garbage terminator, but the abstraction is not perfect: packets have a decoy bit, but the decoy bit of the garbage authentication is ignored. In retrospect, seeing both specification and (one) implementation, it appears simpler to merge the auth packet and version packet.\n\nAs for conceptual way of looking at it, I believe this makes sense:\n* We see the packet abstraction as consisting of two layers:\n  * The lower-level length encoding + aead\n  * The higher-level notion of header byte and decoy packets.\n* The change here is moving the garbage auth functionality to the lower-level layer: whenever additional authentication is needed, the first packet (at this layer decoy or not does not matter, so the first whether that's a decoy or not) after it does that authentication. And the higher-level header/decoy functionality remains for version and application level packets, where this feature makes sense.",

      "body": "> The 1.5 round trip handshake could arguably be more obscure if described/implemented as:\r\n\r\nJust for my understanding: You're saying that the handshake could look more obscure to wiretappers, right? And not that the description of the handshake in the BIP would be more obscure to readers? ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n> (otherwise the \"garbage-terminator + version packet\" may be identifiable as a fixed size response?)\r\n\r\nI don't think so. The \"garbage-terminator + version packet\" is always preceded by some form \"garbage\". So if you want to get rid of the fixed-size response, you can also just send garbage. And yes, if you need more bytes, you can always send more decoys after the version packet, but I don't think this needs to be in the handshake description. (You can *always* send decoys.) \r\n\r\n > Does it make sense to have a decoy packet before the version packet rather than after it? The version packet tells you how to interpret the header, so it seems slightly odd to be parsing headers before you've actually figured out what the header format is.\r\n\r\nI agree that it seems odd to parse headers before you've agreed on a version. And @sipa had similar remarks when we talked about this somewhere else. The thing is that we bootstrap communications, so we build up the layers step by step. And yes, you can argue that at the point when we've just received the garbage terminator, we have not agreed on a header format yet. \r\n\r\nAnd I agree that the possibility to send decoy packets before the version packet doesn't really add functionality. Instead of ignoring the ignore bit (what we do in the current BIP), we could also get rid of this by dropping the header byte entirely (what you suggest). Another way is to simply disallow packages where the ignore bit is set. Though, I don't believe that this will make things simpler. It's adding back a special rule again. \r\n\r\nSo I think if we agree that it makes sense to drop the explicit garbage authentication packet and get rid of one state in the state machine, then I see the following possibilities after the garbage terminator.\r\n1. Switch to \"normal\" packet handling, but the first packet has AAD set: This is what this PR proposes.\r\n2. Like 1, but additionally ignore the ignore bit: This is what the current BIP says, and it has a special case which could be avoided.\r\n3. Like 1, but additionally reject the first packet if it's a decoy packet and disconnect: On one hand, that's just a different special case. On the other hand, then it's then always the case that the AAD is in the version packet.\r\n4. Switch to a simpler headerless packet format just for the version negotiation: This is what you propose. It seems conceptually cleaner, but this requires that we expose a way to parse headerless packets to the high-level net code. In that sense. I don't see how a rule \"parse a raw version packet and delegate further packets to version-specific decoder\" is much simpler than a rule \"parse a v2 version packet, and delegate further packets to version-specific decoder\".  The former will always need one parser more, namely one for raw packets.\r\n\r\nAmong these approaches, I like 1 and 3 most. \r\n\r\nI think approach 1 (in this PR) is conceptually nice because it decouples the AAD stuff from the protocol states. You simply keep a variable around that tells what you expect as AAD in the next received packet [1]. Approach 3 does not need this variable and just needs an `if (ignore) return false` in the VERSION state in the C code. That's also pretty simple. Happy to switch to this approach, I guess it's really on par with approach 1.   \r\n\r\n> It might be slightly clearer to make the pseudocode more stateful as far as the aad info goes, ie drop it as a parameter to `v2_enc_packet` and `v2_receive_packet` and instead initialize it based on `peer.sent_garbage` and `peer.recv_garbage`, and clear them after first use?\r\n\r\nWill probably give this a shot later.\r\n\r\n[1] Note that when you wrote your comment here, the way I was implementing this  (https://github.com/real-or-random/bitcoin/blob/8753b6af9bf8767be50d71d1bf7e3711738fcfd2/src/net.cpp#L1239-L1278) technically did not achieve this decoupling yet. I've improved this now in the implementation PR this by renaming the `m_recv_buffer` to `m_recv_aad` and handling AAD independently of whether the receiver is in `VERSION` state or not. This also means that the handling of the ignore bit does not depend on the state. ",

Still kinda think mentioning decoy packets as well as garbage in the 1.5 round trip summary would be clearer; but the rest of the BIP already makes it pretty clear anyway, so :man_shrugging: \r\n\r\n> The purpose of having decoy functionality available during the VERSION phase is mostly for future extensions that may extend the number of messages that can be sent in that phase.\r\n\r\nHmm, I guess I look at the layers as:\r\n\r\n * \"over the wire\":\r\n   - negotiate a key\r\n   - send packets\r\n   - handle rekeying\r\n   - negotiate \"application support\" for future extensibility\r\n   - do all that while looking like a pseudorandom stream\r\n * \"application layer\":\r\n   - is dispatched to different applications (decoy -> /dev/null, bitcoin p2p -> net_processing)\r\n   - application layer just sees packet contents (and the session key)\r\n   - someday, when the decoy \"application\" actually sends data, it might become an actual complicated application in its own right, eg in order to mimic traffic patterns of some other protocol\r\n   - someday, if we get really worried about obscuring things, messages being sent might go through a third layer that delays them a bit to try to make it harder to do timing analysis or figure out packet boundaries\r\n\r\nie, I guess I think \"negotiate for future extensibility\" is essentially a \"meta application\" that's built into the bip324 (or future extension bip) implementation, that while it gets data from packets just like a regular application, also controls how data from packets goes to applications, so it's really a low-level thing, not a high-level thing. Maybe \"built-in as part of the implementation\" vs \"user of the API\" is more the distinction that I'm thinking of.\r\n\r\n> Just as a note, if we'd go for an approach with 2 layers, where some parts use headerless packets and other parts use headerful packets, the length descriptor semantics need to change too (because they're currently excluding the header byte length).\r\n\r\nYeah, I guess that makes sense: better to be able to have a full 0xFF_FFFF bytes of application data in a packet than be off by two instead of just one. I also guess that's easy enough to extend in some future version if it's ever desirable:\r\n\r\n * 16MiB isn't enough: if bit 6 of the header is set, concatenate the contents of the next packet, and repeat, until you can send gigameg blocks back to the application as a single unit\r\n * 8 bits of header isn't enough: if bit 5 of the header is set, the first however many bytes of the contents is a varint header\r\n \r\nLGTM :+1:",

      "body": "I'm really not convinced that separating headerless and headerful packets is worth it.\r\n\r\nAt a conceptual level you can say:\r\n* (1) In the BIP right now, garbage auth packets are headerless, while version and application packets are headerful. The rationale arguably is that the initial phase has its own traffic shaping mechanism (garbage) so it has no need for decoy packets anyway. However, the instantiation of the garbage auth packets still used header bytes, leading to the inconsistency (ignoring decoy bits) that led to this PR.\r\n* (2) In the proposed BIP change in this PR, garbage auth packets are gone, and the remaining packets (version and application) are headerful both conceptually and in the way they are instantiated. While it's true that the version phase right now needs no traffic shaping (because it's so short the shaping can be done by the phase that follows), it's not true conceptually that version negotiation needs no shaping entirely (something that could become apparent with future extensions).\r\n* (3) In what we're discussing now, version packets become conceptually headerless, but application packets stay headerful. That can be done with or without getting rid of the header byte entirely, but I'm not sure any either is all that appealing:\r\n  * (3a) Version packets retain a header byte, but it is ignored (resulting in a similar inconsistency to how garbage auth packets has ignored header bytes right now).\r\n  * (3b) Version packets have no header byte at all (meaning implementations gain some complexity due to distinguishing the two types of packets). This means changing the meaning of length descriptors (either make them depend on the phase, or deal with application level packets that are too short to contain a header). Version extensions may need a traffic shaping mechanism, but this could be done by enabling headers mid-phase, or having their own ad-hoc shaping mechanism (or extensions could of course overhaul the decoy mechanism entirely).\r\n\r\nSo while it does make sense to see the version negotiation as the thing that negotiates there being a decoy mechanism, and so logically that phase itself shouldn't already have them, I don't think this practically gains us anything:\r\n* Right now (ignoring future extensions) the specification and implementation seem simpler with (2) simply because there is only one type of packet, and its semantics are always the same.\r\n* For future extensions, it may or may not be desirable to have the same decoy mechanism present during the version negotiation, but if it isn't, it can still be changed.",

I'm undrafting the PR because there seems to be broad agreement that we want to do this.\r\n\r\n@ajtowns \r\n\r\n> Still kinda think mentioning decoy packets as well as garbage in the 1.5 round trip summary would be clearer; but the rest of the BIP already makes it pretty clear anyway, so 🤷‍♂️\r\n\r\nOk, that makes sense. We mentioned it everywhere in the BIP except in this summary. Added it to the summary for consistency.\r\n\r\n> It might be slightly clearer to make the pseudocode more stateful as far as the aad info goes, ie drop it as a parameter to `v2_enc_packet` and `v2_receive_packet` and instead initialize it based on `peer.sent_garbage` and `peer.recv_garbage`, and clear them after first use?\r\n\r\nI tried this, but I'm not convinced that this will make it clearer: Keeping the state local to `complete_handshake` also has its merits and keeping the AAD logic there keeps it close to where this logic is explained in prose.

Or more accurately, by merging\nit with the first packet sent after garbage termination, which may be\na decoy packet or the version packet.\n\nThe new protocol simplifies implementations:\n - A protocol state machine won't need separate states for garbage\n   authentication and version phases.\n - The special case of \"ignoring the ignore bit\" is removed.\n - The freedom to choose the contents of the garbage authentication\n   packet is removed. This simplifies testing.\n\nThe reason for having a separate garbage authentication packet was\nto materialize the separation of the key exchange phase and version\nnegotiation phase even in the bytestream on the wire. However, this\nis not necessary, and arguably, these phases are still properly\nseparated: Since the AEAD will ensure that AAD (=garbage) is checked\nbefore looking at the contents (=version), the peers won't interpret\nversion data before having authenticated the garbage.",
