But it's important to make these DoS issues and CTV's design w.r.t. clear, especially since the adding of the example checker logic did make the BIP's spec dos-able (though not any reference implementation).",

      "body": "Quoting yourself:\n\n> I think 340 is a bit higher quality since it's a cryptographic spec, but the BIP can't be implemented AFAICT from the other BIPs since they lack a lot of little details that are still consensus critical.\n\nBIP-340,342, and 342 are obviously not specification BIPs as they're missing the detail required to actually specify behavior. They outline intentions: the actual specification is, as always, the code. You're trying to do a specification BIP and failing because you're leaving out details.\n\nFWIW I'd say Taproot's BIPs are sloppy in that regard and don't do a good job in explaining intentions - they need diagrams for that. But it doesn't matter that much now that they've been deployed.",
