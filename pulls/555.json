          "body": "I've come to the realization that both @veleslavs & @jonasschnelli's proposal at #24 and the original DID:BTCR proposal are all basically different methods, which the top level DID spec specifically encourages and supports.\r\n\r\nIf we do one for Lightcoin as well (LTCR? TX2?) and if Blockstack (BLST? cc: @muneeb-ali @shea256  ) also joins us, this means that we could all use the common bech32 encoding for our Decentralized IDentifiers.\r\n\r\nThinking through this further, this has some consequences  on our design.\r\n\r\nFirst, we've been proposing so far a DID that looks like my test DID of did:btcr:tx1-xxyv-xxxx-fpmf-u0 — however, in fact, we don't need the tx1 prefix as that is actually a method designator. So it could be shorter and thus `did:btcr:xxyv-xxxx-fpmf-u0`, and @jonasschnelli DID would be `did:tx1:rk63-uvxf-9pqc-sy` — both would be W3C conforming URNs and valid DIDs.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is another level of redundancy that we could consider. The bech32 encoding (see #2) actually has 'magic bytes' in it that signify the chain. In my case `xxyv-xxxx-fpmf-u0` the first `x` tells us to look for the transaction on the bitcoin testnet, and in @jonasschnelli's case `rk63-uvxf-9pqc-sy`  the first `r` tells us to look at the bitcoin main chain. Future magic numbers could tell us to look at a fork of the bitcoin main chain (hopefully none of those happen!), at a lightcoin chain, a sidechain, etc.\r\n\r\nThis leads to the possibility is that it could be instead be used as a submethod identifier —` r` and `x` are for the tx1 style DIDs on main chain and testnet, new magic codes for `s` and `y` could be for btcr style DIDs on main chain and testnet, and some other values could be for lightcoin or used for Blockstack's proposal.\r\n\r\nf we can agree to a common root method spec, supporting all the variants, this could be useful. It does mean that there is a centralization of assignment of the magic codes, but that is also true for DID methods (for which we at least use the W3C process). \r\n\r\nThe disadvantage of combining is that anyone with a fifth idea or future idea would have a harder time getting a new submethod proposal once a joint proposal was publish. The advantage to everyone having a different DID method identifier is that they all can compete in the marketplace of ideas freely as anyone can propose a DID method. Of course we can also leave the differences between all these variants as separate but open submethod specs ;-)\r\n\r\nFor now I suggest we keep them as separate method specs, and help @veleslavs & @jonasschnelli create a parallel TX1 DID spec conforming to the W3C process with their BIP proposal. We can discuss if there are sufficient commonalities that it makes sense to go into creating submethod specs for the differences.",

It also enables support for getting transactions that are in orphaned blocks.\r\n\r\nNote that supplying a block hash will override mempool and txindex support in `GetTransaction`. The rationale behind this is that a transaction may be in multiple places (orphaned blocks) and if the user supplies an explicit block hash it should be adhered to.\r\n\r\n```Bash\r\n$ # a41.. is a tx inside an orphan block ..3c6f.. -- first try getting it normally\r\n$ ./bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction a41e66ee1341aa9fb9475b98cfdc1fe1261faa56c0a49254f33065ec90f7cd79 1\r\nerror code: -5\r\nerror message:\r\nNo such mempool transaction.

Implementers should take care to display this information in a clear way to the users.\r\n\r\nHowever I think that the non-bitcoin related magic code listing should be moved to a SLIP.  I will leave Litecoin as an exception; as I've granted it a first-class 5-bit code, (maybe this should be reviewed and a 2nd class 10-byte magic code should be used for Litecoin). @jonasschnelli what do you think?",

The spec could read\r\n```\r\nuse the SLIP-0173 coin prefix, followed by `-tx` as the human-readable part\r\n```\r\nFor instance, I would read `bc-tx1:rqqq-qqqq-qmhu-qk` as \"bitcoin-transaction *blah*.\"",

The core reason is that I don't expect users to memorise and use many different Human Readable Parts in real-life. -  I expect the Developers of the GUI to clearly display what network (or unknown network) the TxRef relates to.\r\n\r\nUsers should not be expected to understand this specification; hence, they will only see \"tx1:\" and then know they can copy-paste or click on it and the application will do everything for them.  (the application should say: \"hey this is a Bitcoin / Litecoin / Sidechain / Extension Block / etc Transaction Reference\".  Then direct the user to do an appropriate action.\r\n\r\nIn the future users will not install 10 different *coin wallets, they will instead install a block-explorer that support 10 different alt-coins and sidechains and all colours of different variants, and have that link to wallet apps they use.",

          "body": "_From @ChristopherA on July 9, 2017 23:11_\n\nI've come to the realization that both @veleslavs & @jonasschnelli's proposal at #24 and the original DID:BTCR proposal are all basically different methods, which the top level DID spec specifically encourages and supports.\r\n\r\nIf we do one for Lightcoin as well (LTCR? TX2?) and if Blockstack (BLST? cc: @muneeb-ali @shea256  ) also joins us, this means that we could all use the common bech32 encoding for our Decentralized IDentifiers.\r\n\r\nThinking through this further, this has some consequences  on our design.\r\n\r\nFirst, we've been proposing so far a DID that looks like my test DID of did:btcr:tx1-xxyv-xxxx-fpmf-u0 — however, in fact, we don't need the tx1 prefix as that is actually a method designator. So it could be shorter and thus `did:btcr:xxyv-xxxx-fpmf-u0`, and @jonasschnelli DID would be `did:tx1:rk63-uvxf-9pqc-sy` — both would be W3C conforming URNs and valid DIDs.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is another level of redundancy that we could consider. The bech32 encoding (see #2) actually has 'magic bytes' in it that signify the chain. In my case `xxyv-xxxx-fpmf-u0` the first `x` tells us to look for the transaction on the bitcoin testnet, and in @jonasschnelli's case `rk63-uvxf-9pqc-sy`  the first `r` tells us to look at the bitcoin main chain. Future magic numbers could tell us to look at a fork of the bitcoin main chain (hopefully none of those happen!), at a lightcoin chain, a sidechain, etc.\r\n\r\nThis leads to the possibility is that it could be instead be used as a submethod identifier —` r` and `x` are for the tx1 style DIDs on main chain and testnet, new magic codes for `s` and `y` could be for btcr style DIDs on main chain and testnet, and some other values could be for lightcoin or used for Blockstack's proposal.\r\n\r\nf we can agree to a common root method spec, supporting all the variants, this could be useful. It does mean that there is a centralization of assignment of the magic codes, but that is also true for DID methods (for which we at least use the W3C process). \r\n\r\nThe disadvantage of combining is that anyone with a fifth idea or future idea would have a harder time getting a new submethod proposal once a joint proposal was publish. The advantage to everyone having a different DID method identifier is that they all can compete in the marketplace of ideas freely as anyone can propose a DID method. Of course we can also leave the differences between all these variants as separate but open submethod specs ;-)\r\n\r\nFor now I suggest we keep them as separate method specs, and help @veleslavs & @jonasschnelli create a parallel TX1 DID spec conforming to the W3C process with their BIP proposal. We can discuss if there are sufficient commonalities that it makes sense to go into creating submethod specs for the differences.\n\n_Copied from original issue: WebOfTrustInfo/btcr-hackathon#26_",

          "body": "_From @ChristopherA on June 30, 2017 6:44_\n\nI really like idea of using a bech32 encoded DID:BTCR as @sipa did some amazing work investing a good error detecting AND correcting encoding algorithm.  https://github.com/sipa/bech32\r\n\r\n@veleslavs & @jonasschnelli's proposal for encoding the transaction index and block number also make great sense, and I like that the magic values can be used to identify different variants blockchains close to bitcoin (I hope they propose a lightcoin value as it already supports segwit) https://github.com/veleslavs/bips/blob/Bech32_Encoded_TxRef/bip-XXXX-Bech32_Encoded_Transaction_Postion_References.mediawiki\r\n\r\nHowever, this proposal is still not officially a BIP, we don't know who else is supporting it, has not been adopted elsewhere, and may change. \r\n\r\nWe should check with Blockstack to see if they are up to supporting this proposal or if they have reservation. (I hope they like it).\r\n\r\ncc: @muneeb-ali @shea256 @jcnelson\n\n_Copied from original issue: WebOfTrustInfo/btcr-hackathon#2_",

      "body": "@jtimon  Thank you for your review of the magic encodings in our proposal.\r\n\r\nI would like to attempt to address your concerns.\r\n\r\nOn Litecoin or any other, altcoin, testchain or altchain being described in this BIP:\r\n\r\nIf this is a genuine concern, I will move the non-bitcoin magic code registration to a SLIP or other place that it doesn't disturb this BIP process. However, I think that the religious exclusion of the acknowledgement that crypto-finance is broader than just Bitcoin hurts the BIP process overall. (Personally, I think that the focus of a BIP should be Bitcoin, however not to the strict exclusion of any detail that isn't related to Bitcoin.)\r\n\r\nI also seek clarification that you suggest that we should also remove all references to the test-network, this would very likely be used by the Bitcoin Testnet.\r\n\r\nOn using as salt for the Bech32 encoding:\r\nI recommend that this should not be done for two reasons.\r\n\r\n1.  This is a security risk, as this opens up the possibility that a single TxRef may reference more than one transaction. (A cryptographic hash of 160bit is sufficient for such salting.  However Bech32 is a non-cryptographic 30bit checksum).\r\n2. This will break the Bech32 standard and cannot be considered Bech32 encoding.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn using the human-readable-part for designating the network:\r\nMy most recent reasoning why I recommend against this approach is in my comment above:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/555#issuecomment-315512489\r\n\r\nI will take the time to revise this BIP so that this comment can be included in the rationale.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn your testchains proposal:\r\nI do not understand how this proposal is conceptually incompatible with the testchains proposal.

      "body": "@jtimon One of the key design goals of the TxRef was to keep it very short. If we include 256bit checksum then, of course that could support infinite chain-types.\r\n\r\nGreat effort has been taken to keep the number of bits to encode low (in the case for Bitcoin, 40bits are needed), while still extendable. (for a total 70bits with checksum).\r\n\r\nI am unaware of any way to have the cake and eat it also:  Keep the number of bits low, and not have a central place to lookup Networks Magic Values.\r\n\r\nI'm not against making a additional _by-hash-of-genisis_ display-format for the catch-all case.  However this would not be the case of a short TxRef anymore, It would be about 250bit long in total. (salted_hash(160) + block height (30) + tx_position (30) + checksum (30)).\r\n\r\nI'm also unconvinced that Test Network TxRef need to be globally unique.  For test-networks you can just prefix the full 256bit genesis hash to the HRP, however, such TxRef's shouldn't be use outside of strict testing purposes. As Test Networks Should only be used within their Testing Scope.",

If we include 256bit checksum then, of course that could support infinite chain-types.\r\n\r\nI don't mean including the genesis block in either the txref nor the checksum, only taking it into account when calculating the checksum. The chain id must be known to calculate the checksum. \r\nMy understanding is that this is possible, but perhaps @sipa or someone else can correct me.\r\n\r\n> However this would not be the case of a short TxRef anymore, It would be about 250bit long in total. (salted_hash(160) + block height (30) + tx_position (30) + checksum (30)).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure where this numbers come from, but perhaps the specification could contain something like this?\r\nAre these the dimensions you have in mind without my suggestion?\r\n\r\nmagic numbers(5) + block height (30) + tx_position (30) + checksum (30) = 95 bit ?\r\nIf so, with my suggestion the data part would not become bigger but smaller, since the magic numbers are removed and everything else remains the same.\r\n",

And you had no notion of chainID before. This is something new, please find another name to avoid confussion.\r\n\r\n> This is why I proposed a 160bit crypto-salted-checksum, because that would have the security properties where it would be infeasible to find a intersection. Maybe 256bit would be needed in reality to protect against birthday attacks.\r\n\r\nPlease stop trying to \"fix\" my suggestion and focus on understanding it first. Yes, I'm proposing to use 256 bits for the chain ID, just not include it as part of the txref.\r\n\r\n> @jtimon I propose the following non-standard display format:\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to remove the 5 bit magic part and the newly introduced 30 bit \"something that is not a chain ID\".\r\nThus with my proposal the txref is smaller, not bigger.\r\n\r\nYou may ask, if it's not inthe txref, where is the 256 bit chain ID?\r\n\r\nNowhere. Either the programs assume it, or they know which one to use (exclusively for the checksum) from the human readable part.\r\n\r\nHow is it involved in the checksum if it's not part of the data part of txref ? \r\n\r\nBefore calculating the checksum, you append the extra 256 bits.\r\n\r\nForget for a moment it is a chain ID. We could append the same extra constant 256 bits before calculating the checksum, right?\r\n\r\n> Bitcoin can use it's own special optimised format, Other Networks that want an optimised format can use the SLIP process\r\n\r\nTo reiterate: my point is that no special case is needed for any chain, not even the main chain. And the SLIP process is not needed here at all.\r\n",

      "body": "This sounds like a bad idea-- unless I'm misunderstanding something:  This proposal is not reorg safe or chain split safe.   It claims that txids don't have a checksum but txid's _are_ a checksum.\r\n\r\nThe document is thin on supporting motivations, but it seems to me that using a block hash and index (plus a check value) or a block hash and transaction hash would be strictly superior; and avoid those problems.\r\n\r\nThough even with identifying the block it is likely an error to expect people to have them in the future.  Bitcoin has been pretty carefully designed to require no random access to the blockchain and it is my expectation that in the future almost no nodes will.    At that point anything built using this will be pushed onto centralized services, which is against the stated purpose of this document-- it would actually be creating the centralization it hopes to avoid.\r\n\r\nThere is already a facility built into Bitcoin software to identify transactions in blocks without requiring the verifier actually have the blocks, see gettxoutproof and verifytxoutproof  in Bitcoin Core. I believe these achieve what you're looking to accomplish in a much better manner; though it isn't \"short\" because it's not depending on the network to store and retrieve things on your behalf.\r\n",

Since it's only 30 bits of checksum, with 2^15 tries you can create a collision that is valid for more than 1 network.\r\nThus you would still need something on the human readable part (or the 'magic' bits I strongly dislike) to discriminate chain even if you follow my suggestion of using the 256 bits of the chain when calculating the checksum.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it seems there's more important concerns with the proposal than mine.\r\n",

      "body": "@gmaxwell Thank you for your time taken looking-over this document.\r\n\r\nFirstly, thank you for the comment on the motivations section of this proposal; I will expand on them here and then update the document for future reviews.\r\n\r\n1.  The primary motivation is to have a very-shot way of describing deeply buried transactions within a particular blockchain. We don't recommend the use of this proposal to reference transaction with less than 100 confirmations.\r\n2.  The reason that we wish to reference deeply buried transactions is for linking to various special transactions within the blockchain, such as proof-of-burn, and possible identity enrolment transactions.\r\n3. A key consideration has been to try and keep the transaction position references as short as possible.\r\n\r\nI would now like to attempt to address some of your concerns:\r\nPlease note that this proposal makes no attempt to point to an actual transaction, this proposal is to reference transaction positions within a blockchain, as clearly stated in the abstract, with emphasis:\r\n\r\n> Please note: that a TxRef does not reference an actual transaction itself, rather it references a possible location within a blockchain for a transaction, that may or may not, point to an actual transaction and may change with reorganisations.''\r\n\r\nYou are quite right that this proposal is not reorg safe for referencing transactions. However, this proposal doesn't reference transactions, rather transaction positions that are completely re-org safe.\r\n\r\nThe use of transaction positions to reference transactions should only be done in special situations: in particular when a transaction has been buried for a significant amount of time.\r\n\r\n>  Therefore, implementers must be careful not to display TxRef's to users prematurely:\r\n>  * Applications MUST NOT display TxRef's for transactions with less than 6 confirmations.\r\n>  * Application MUST show a warning for TxRef's for transactions with less than 100 confirmations.\r\n>    * This warning SHOULD state that in the case of a large reorganization, the TxRefs Displayed may point to a different transaction, or to no transaction at all.\r\n\r\nYour comment about new the transaction positions becoming inconsistent in the case of a persistent chain-split is apt.  Transaction position references may represent more than one chain in the case of schism fork.  (until the ChainID or Network Magic values have been updated to compensate for this fact).  If such a schism fork is planned for a future time, we would recommend the users of the affected chains to negotiate new magic numbers, (or use new ChainID’s).\r\n\r\nI recommend that a new BIP, or an extension to this proposal that uses the full-block-hash + transaction position within the block, as you suggested, to be considered.\r\n\r\nAgain, thank you for your time.\r\nYour careful review of our entire proposal would be most welcome.",

      "body": "I think it is very likely that far historic data will not be generally queryable once nodes no longer need it for initialization; we can see that e.g. in the case of ripple they've even lost the historic data, and in the case of ethereum it appears that nodes which attempt to do a full sync will never finish now (though at the moment the data is still available).   I'm sure that the data will exist as an academic exercise somewhere; but not in a way it is today.\r\n\r\nEven at today's rate of blockchain growth it has pretty much become infeasible to store the whole blockchain on the most common SSD size... and that rate of growth is about to double. But even if people can store it multiple days of initialization aren't acceptable, and so I believe nodes will need to transition to a different approach, and once they have there will be little reason for anyone to store it.. except for supporting things like this proposal.\r\n\r\nIn particular I don't want to see node authors being nagged to take on the technical debt of continuing to support carrying around data which isn't actually used by the network on account of an effort to act as a bit of data storage for this proposal.

          "body": "## Intro\r\nOriginally, BTCR used [Bech32 Encoded Transaction Position References](https://github.com/veleslavs/bips/blob/c83837536d6629f754ce5a88bbe245e0a615e76e/bip-XXXX-Bech32_Encoded_Transaction_Position_References.mediawiki) for transaction references, but over time they deviated. We should decide (1) if we really want to do this, and if so, (2) ensure we've properly documented our deviation.\r\n\r\n## Terminology\r\nFor the moment I'll use the following placeholder terminology to refer to our modified form:\r\n- full name: Extended transaction reference\r\n- abbreviation: txref-ext \r\nNote that if we do choose to deviate, we should (3) decide/document the terminology\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nBTCR truncates Bech32 Encoded Transaction Position References (txref) by removing the network prefix. So for example, a txref of `txtest1-xkyt-fzgq-qq87-xnhn` converts to a txref-ext of `xkyt-fzgq-qq87-xnhn`. The [conversion library](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/txref-conversion-js) still uses txrefs, so that we can match the testcases referred to in the reference implementation. But the BTCR libraries handle this conversion by removing/adding back the txref prefix. See the [btcr-did-tools library](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/btcr-did-tools-js), see [util.ensureTxref](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/btcr-did-tools-js/blob/master/util.js#L22).\r\n\r\nThe primary reason was to shorten the DIDs, but we discussed at RWoT 5 whether this deviation was worth it.\r\n\r\nThe following additional reasons were mentioned: \r\n- In the future we may also want to encode a specific tx output\r\n- The txref BIP won't be adopted (how do we know this?)\r\n- Ability to refer to alt chains\r\n- Ability to refer to lightning channel ids\r\n\r\nOpening an issue to confirm this decision and follow up on items (1)-(3)\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n- [BIP 139 PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/555)\r\n",

I'm sorry for my long-stretch of absence.\r\n\r\n@jonasschnelli and @kulpreet , In particular I hope to have your careful review. Please also update your reference implementations, and please send me an updated set of test-vectors that I'll Include in the BIP.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOverall, the technical changes to this BIP has been the modification from a 70-bit Data Payload to a 75-bit Payload (for Bitcoin). Additionally, now MainNet and TestNet use an almost identical format.\r\n\r\n* This allows the Bitcoin TxRef reference upto 32768 tx instead of 8192 tx, as with segwit it is reasonable that a block might be constructed with more than 8191 tx's.\r\n* Additionally, the maximum block-height is increased from 2 097 151 to 16 777 215, increasing the maximum from around year 2048 to around year 2328.\r\n\r\nThis comes at the cost of one-extra character.",

      "body": "I remain unconvinced that this is useful as written. @gmaxwell 's comments about archival data notwithstanding, it seems overly complex for its purpose.\r\n\r\nLet's consider two cases:\r\n\r\n**Machine-to-machine**\r\n\r\nIf two machines want to communicate the position of a transaction, they would simply use the block height and txid. There is no real need for brevity or additional checksums between machines, and a txid lookup within a block is a small linear search. Checksum information would be present in the machine connection itself, so it is not needed in the message format.\r\n\r\n**Person-to-person**\r\n\r\nThe spec says `As TxRef's are short, we expect that they will be quoted via voice or written by hand.` It may take a shorter amount of time to communicate two numbers for block height and tx position than the fewer-but-random letters. So @luke-jr 's proposal above of something like `tx:<chain>/<block>/<position>` would yield `tx:bc/0/0` for the genesis transaction. It remains human-readable but also becomes human-understandable. All coinbase transactions would have `/0`, making them recognizable.\r\n\r\nYou could add a variable number of bytes of the txid as a \"checksum\" of sorts, similar to Git using 4 bytes of the commit hash (`tx:bc/541091/4/a51f` appends two bytes). You could also change the `/` to be something else (`-`,`:`,`_`).\r\n\r\nThis alternate proposal suffers from no limitations on ultimate block height or transaction count.",

      "body": "We have been using a slight variant of txref in the #RebootingWebOfTrust for the BTC Decentralized Identifier method called BTCR (https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2018/blob/master/draft-documents/btcr_resolver.md implementations at https://github.com/dcdpr/btcr-DID-method and https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/txref-conversion-java). The biggest difference is that we added an optional output index. If the output index is absent, it is considered 0 (and thus matches the older TXREF exactly), and if it is encoded it is the index.\r\n\r\nAn addition to our use, a particular advantage of the encoding with the output index is that this is basically what the Lightning Network uses for nodeids. In we add this to TXREF means that a bech32 txref can also be used as a shorter more readable alternative to the current hex notation for Lightning Nodes. (cc @rustyrussell)",

      "body": "@veleslavs The changes @ChristopherA is referring to are detailed in a branch I made from an old version of your BIP. We proposed adding extra bits to encode the output index in the txref. I modified your old BIP with two new sections for display formats \"0-ext\" and \"A-ext\" You can see those additions here: https://github.com/danpape/bips/commit/c8ab8c9aa0de1667045d030208143930d0d8c85a  I'm sorry to have dragged my feet asking to you review them--now that you have made significant changes to your BIP I can revise my changes and get them to you in a few days if you are interested in incorporating them into this BIP. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the C and Go implementations you note in your new BIP, @kimdhamilton has one for javascript: https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/txref-conversion-java , @rxgrant and I have one for C++ within https://github.com/dcdpr/btcr-DID-method. Both implementations support the \"txref-ext\" proposal. Finally, I have changes I can submit to jonasschnelli for adding \"txref-ext\" support in the original C code: https://github.com/danpape/bitcoin_txref_code/commit/1d04b9db9d6b006fdffd90cd7e60b1750a27a6d9\r\n ",

However the format of this particular BIP is more focused, and has different use case in mind. I would suggest such a URI design should be made with a new BIP.",

However, we do keep the txref `magic code` in the Bech32 data part, to identify testnet references.

TxID's are a core part of the consensus protocol and were naturally exported to the user-space since the first release of Bitcoin.\n+\n+However, for many use-cases they have practical limitations:\n+* TxID's are expensive for full nodes to lookup.\n+* TxID's require third-party service for SPV wallets to lookup.\n+* TxID's are very long HEX encoded values (64 characters long).\n+* TxID's are without checksums.\n+For transactions that have been embedded in the blockchain, it is possible to reference them not by their ID, but by their location within the blockchain itself. In this document, we propose a standard for doing this.\n+\n+=== Examples ===\n+All examples use the ''Bitcoin Display Format 0'' described in ''Bitcoin Display Formats'' appendix.\n+* Genesis Coinbase Transaction: <tt>tx1-rqqq-qqqq-qmhu-qk</tt>\n+* Transaction #2205 of Block #466793: <tt>tx1-rjk0-u5ng-4jsf-mc</tt>\n+\n+== Specification ==\n+\n+A '''confirmed transaction position reference''', or '''TxRef''' is reference to a particular location within the blockchain specified by the block height and the transaction position.\n+\n+''Please Note: All values in this specification are encoded in little-endian format.''\n+\n+A TxRef may reference a location that doesn't exist because:\n+* The block height hasn't been minded yet.\n+* The Transaction Position is more than the total transaction within the referenced block.\n+Therefore, implementers must be careful not to display TxRef's to users prematurely:\n+* Applications MUST NOT display TxRef's for transactions with less than 6 confirmations.\n+* Application MUST show a warning for TxRef's for transactions with less than 100 confirmations.\n+** This warning SHOULD state that in the case of a large reorganization, the TxRefs Displayed may point to a different transaction, or to no transaction at all.\n+\n+=== Human Display Formats ===\n+This specification provides standardisation of encoding and namespacing for '''application display formats'''.\n+\n+If a display format doesn't comply with this standard, it MUST be called a '''non-standard application display format'''.",

      "body": "I can understand the desire to keep all reference strings to the nice 14-character version by keeping the data payload to these 40 bits, but it seems to place artificial limitations on the format (year 2048 & 8191 transactions). I also understand that this might be addressed with Version 1 encoding. But current blocks are not that far from having 8191 transactions.\r\n\r\nYou could go with a variable-length encoding similar to Bitcoin's variable ints and gain the benefit of having a format that will work for very large blocks and the very far future.\r\n\r\nAlso, the Bech32 reference libraries allow encoding from byte arrays into the base-5 arrays native to Bech32. It seems like bit-packing to these 40 bits might be overkill. As an alternative you could have one bit-packed byte to start:\r\n```\r\n# First two bits are the protocol version, supporting values 0-3\r\nV = ((protocol version) & 0x03) << 6\r\n# Next two bits are magic for the blockchain\r\n# 0x00 = Bitcoin\r\n# 0x01 = Testnet3\r\n# 0x02 = Byte1 is another coin's magic code (gives 256 options)\r\n# 0x03 = Byte1-2 is treated as the coin magic code (gives 65280 more options)\r\nM = (magic & 0x03) << 4\r\n# Next two bits are the byte length of the block reference\r\nB = ((byte length of block reference) & 0x03) << 2\r\n# Final two bits are the byte length of the transaction index\r\nT = ((byte length of transaction index) & 0x03)\r\n# Assemble into the first byte\r\nByte0 = V | M | B | T\r\n```\r\nThis gives you up to 3 bytes for each block and transaction reference, which is 16.7 M blocks, or year 2336, and 16.7 M transaction slots.\r\n```\r\nData part: [Byte0][optional magic bytes 1-2][block reference bytes][tx reference bytes]\r\n```\r\nSo the shortest data part would have 3 bytes in it, with the reference version `0` genesis coinbase transaction having data part `0x050000`.\r\n\r\nI know this is a departure from your vision, but it would be much more flexible for the long term (in my opinion).",

TxID's are a core part of the consensus protocol and were naturally exported to the user-space since the first release of Bitcoin.\n+\n+However, for many use-cases they have practical limitations:\n+* TxID's are expensive for full nodes to lookup.\n+* TxID's require third-party service for SPV wallets to lookup.\n+* TxID's are very long HEX encoded values (64 characters long).\n+* TxID's are without checksums.\n+For transactions that have been embedded in the blockchain, it is possible to reference them not by their ID, but by their location within the blockchain itself. In this document, we propose a standard for doing this.\n+\n+=== Examples ===\n+All examples use the ''Bitcoin Display Format 0'' described in ''Bitcoin Display Formats'' appendix.\n+* Genesis Coinbase Transaction: <tt>tx1:rqqq-qqqq-qmhu-qk</tt>\n+* Transaction #2205 of Block #466793: <tt>tx1:rjk0-u5ng-4jsf-mc</tt>\n+\n+== Specification ==\n+\n+A '''confirmed transaction position reference''', or '''TxRef''' is reference to a particular location within the blockchain specified by the block height and the transaction position.\n+\n+''Please Note: All values in this specification are encoded in little-endian format.''\n+\n+A TxRef may reference a location that doesn't exist because:\n+* The block height hasn't been minded yet.\n+* The Transaction Position is more than the total transaction within the referenced block.\n+Therefore, implementers must be careful not to display TxRef's to users prematurely:\n+* Applications MUST NOT display TxRef's for transactions with less than 6 confirmations.\n+* Application MUST show a warning for TxRef's for transactions with less than 100 confirmations.\n+** This warning SHOULD state that in the case of a large reorganization, the TxRefs Displayed may point to a different transaction, or to no transaction at all.\n+\n+=== Human Display Formats ===\n+This specification provides standardisation of encoding and namespacing for '''application display formats'''.\n+\n+If a display format doesn't comply with this standard, it MUST be called a '''non-standard application display format'''.\n+\n+==== Encoding ====\n+* All display formats MUST be encoded with standard Bech32<ref>'''Why use Bech32 Encoding for Confirmed Transaction References?'''

We do not wish to expect the users to keep their TxRef's in good unicode form. We expect them to copy, paste, write by-hand, write in a mix of character sets, etc.  Parsers should automatically correct for all of these sorts of errors. However, we only specify the removal of non-bech32-alphabet characters.\n+</ref>\n+\n+==== Namespacing ====\n+* Every non-compatible system MUST use a different '''magic code'''.\n+* The magic code MUST be prefixed to the data payload, and included in the Bech32 encoding.\n+* Applications MUST reject codes with unknown magic codes.\n+* Applications MUST display an error for known, but unsupported magic codes.\n+\n+=== Magic Codes ===\n+* Magic codes are either 5, 10, 15, or 20-bits long.\n+\n+* The length of the magic code is set by the first 5 bits:\n+** 0x0 to 0x7: 5-bit long.

TxID's are a core part of the consensus protocol and were naturally exported to the user-space since the first release of Bitcoin.\n+\n+However, for many use-cases they have practical limitations:\n+* TxID's are expensive for full nodes to lookup.\n+* TxID's require third-party service for SPV wallets to lookup.\n+* TxID's are very long HEX encoded values (64 characters long).\n+* TxID's are without checksums.\n+For transactions that have been embedded in the blockchain, it is possible to reference them not by their ID, but by their location within the blockchain itself. In this document, we propose a standard for doing this.\n+\n+=== Examples ===\n+All examples use the ''Bitcoin Display Format 0'' described in ''Bitcoin Display Formats'' appendix.\n+* Genesis Coinbase Transaction: <tt>tx1:rqqq-qqqq-qmhu-qk</tt>\n+* Transaction #2205 of Block #466793: <tt>tx1:rjk0-u5ng-4jsf-mc</tt>\n+\n+== Specification ==\n+\n+A '''confirmed transaction position reference''', or '''TxRef''' is reference to a particular location within the blockchain specified by the block height and the transaction position.\n+\n+''Please Note: All values in this specification are encoded in little-endian format.''\n+\n+A TxRef may reference a location that doesn't exist because:\n+* The block height hasn't been minded yet.\n+* The Transaction Position is more than the total transaction within the referenced block.\n+Therefore, implementers must be careful not to display TxRef's to users prematurely:\n+* Applications MUST NOT display TxRef's for transactions with less than 6 confirmations.\n+* Application MUST show a warning for TxRef's for transactions with less than 100 confirmations.\n+** This warning SHOULD state that in the case of a large reorganization, the TxRefs Displayed may point to a different transaction, or to no transaction at all.\n+\n+=== Human Display Formats ===\n+This specification provides standardisation of encoding and namespacing for '''application display formats'''.\n+\n+If a display format doesn't comply with this standard, it MUST be called a '''non-standard application display format'''.\n+\n+==== Encoding ====\n+* All display formats MUST be encoded with standard Bech32<ref>'''Why use Bech32 Encoding for Confirmed Transaction References?''' The error detection and correction properties of this encoding format make it very attractive. We expect that it will be reasonable for software to correct a maximum of two characters; however, we haven’t specified this yet.</ref> encoding as defined within the [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki BIP 0173] specification.\n+* The Human Readable Part of the Bech32 encoding MUST be \"tx\"<ref>'''Why use the same Human Readable Part for different systems or blockchains?''' The ‘tx1’ prefix is to namespace the Bech32 encoding to this specification. We use Magic Values internally to namespace between projects.</ref>.\n+* All Non Bech32 alphabet characters after the Bech32 code separator MUST be ignored when parsing (except for terminating characters).<ref>'''Why Strip all Non-Bech32 Alphabet Characters?'''

The point is to have less prune to collisions than a memorable string, which we would need to register somewhere.\r\nIt is sane to assume that altchains will respect BIP173's \"bc\" and \"bt\" but not so much to assume they will know about each other or will wait for some centralized registry to assign them a memorable and \"unique\" string.\r\nOf course if someone wants to \"collide\" one can always still use bitcoin's genesis block for their altchain and \"bc\" to \"identify it\". My point is that altchains that don't want to collide with each other or with btc or any testnet still have it very easy if we rely only on the memorable string (unless we assume the centralized registry is actually maintained or we also use some chain id like the genesis block hash or the first unique block or whatever).\r\n",
