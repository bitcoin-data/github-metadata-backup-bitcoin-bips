This BIP defines a protocol to do so using only the DNS, providing for the ability to query such resolutions privately, while utilizing DNSSEC to provide compact and simple to verify proofs of mappings.\r\n\r\nI'd like to hereby request a BIP number assignment. What is the current approach to do so - since the mailing list has died, is a post on delving bitcoin the appropriate place to publish BIP drafts?",

If you want to have a hardware wallet (which is not online and does not have a TCP stack in it), you really want to be able to hand it a succinct cryptographic proof that the given name matches the given address. You cannot do this with TLS, but DNSSEC makes this trivial (I implemented a validation library http://http-dns-prover.as397444.net/)\n\nRegarding HTTP \"being simpler\", I strongly disagree, actually. If you have a domain, adding a single TXT record to your DNS is generally incredibly simple. Sure, *if* you already have an HTTP server adding a file to it isn't that much work, but even then it's probably as much or more work than just going to your DNS control panel and adding a single record.\n\n> You could allow HTTP .well-known with .onion / .i2p, then these two problems disappear\n\nNot at all, that's a lot of work for everyone trying to implement this. DNS you get this for free! You don't have to do a ton of work to integrate Tor everywhere (which has spotty success at best), you have a proxy already pre-configured on ~every internet-connected machine on the planet!",

      "body": "> I like this! It's implicit in the example, but maybe say explicitly that the combination of USER + DOMAIN should be rendered as an email address, i.e., USER@DOMAIN.\r\n\r\nI'm actually kind of torn on this. I'm no UX expert, but I've seen some legitimate points raised around how this is a bit confusing given users actually confuse them for email addresses. Other systems have gone another way (eg mastodon with @user@domain or bluesky with just user.domain) seemingly for this reason.\r\n\r\nThe nice thing about USER@DOMAIN is that its compatible with existing LNURL (senders can just query DNS and fall back to LNURL when it fails and recipients can thus upgrade as they see fit), but we could also do other things which are subtly compatible but provide UX distinction, eg $user@domain (which is still compatible with LNURL though the $ is very US-centric).\r\n\r\n> This was just announced yesterday, but looks like https://groups.google.com/group/bitcoindev will be the new mailing list hosting (?)\r\n\r\nIndeed, just seems like given the lack of subscribers there that may or may not meet the BIP criteria of posting to the bitcoin-dev ML as a formal part of the BIP proposal process.",

      "body": "> Why not just use OpenAlias, which is already supported in Electrum?\n\nFirst of all i wasn't aware of it until today :). However, while it seems to be conceptually similar in many ways (as far as I can tell the only concrete difference is it's looking up a different name?), this is a more concrete and extensible format for bitcoin payment instructions for wallets which already support and have logic for handling BIP 21 URIs (basically all wallets). AFAICT you could define \"Bitcoin payment instructions\" as encoding bitcoin: URIs in the openalias names specifically and thus \"use OpenAlias\", but (a) you'd still need a BIP like this defining the format and (b) the OpenAlias names clutter the existing domain records, which is undesirable compared to using a clearly Bitcoin-specific name. For example, getting someone to \"add TXT record \"random gibberish\" to their domain is fairly normal to verify a domain name for some service, but one which includes \"_bitcoin-payment\" in the name less so :). Ultimately I'm not sure what difference \"supporting OpenAlias\" would bring here, aside from an extra \"oa1:\" in the TXT record itself and a slightly less descriptive query name.",

      "body": "Great idea.\r\n\r\n@alexgleason asks:\r\n\r\n>>  a custodial provider only needs to add one wildcard record for all users in the lightning context!\r\n\r\n>  How could a wildcard record solve the problem?\r\n\r\nI had the same question. If I understand correctly, wildcard resolutions return the same record for any subdomain, for a central service this would point to the general centralized service's node. You're correct in that you'd then need a secondary lookup mechanism.\r\n\r\nIf you look through the proposed BLIP/BOLTs that are linked in this document, @TheBlueMatt has further defined an onion message protocol that allows you to request a custom offer for a specified user using onion messages.\r\n\r\nThe BLIP proposal states the following: \r\n\r\n```\r\nAlternatively, for recipients which do not wish to publish a unique offer for all possible payees,\r\na wildcard record may be provisioned as *.user._bitcoin-payment.`domain` with the contents\r\n`bitcoin:?omlookup=hex_encoded_blinded_path`. The node receiving onion messages at the given\r\nblinded path is then expected to respond to `offer_request`-containing onion messages with\r\n`offer_response`-containing onion messages.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe BOLT proposal for adding an `offer_request` and `offer_response` can currently be found here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1136/commits/5809dfd1fce7fe1233812acb25bd37b908318968\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but it may be useful for responding apps to provide any-amount BOLT12s as a response, such that wallets/requesting apps can cache these for future payments?\r\n\r\n",

Using DNSSEC, the DNS provides cryptographic guarantees using a straightforward PKI which follows the hierarchical nature of the DNS, allowing for stateless and even offline validation of DNS records from a single trusted root.\n+\n+Further, because DNS queries are generally proxied through ISP-provided or other resolvers, DNS queries usually do not directly expose the queryer's IP address. Further, because of the prevalence of open resolvers, the simplicity of the protocol, and broad availability of DNS recursive resolver implementations, finding a proxy for DNS records is trivial.\n+\n+Thus, using TXT records to store Bitcoin payment instructions allows for human-readable Bitcoin payment destinations which can be trivially verified on hardware wallets and which can be resolved relatively privately.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+=== General rules for handling ===\n+Bitcoin wallets MUST NOT prefer to use DNS-based resolving when methods with explicit public keys are available. In other words, if a standard Bitcoin address or direct BIP 21 URI is available or would suffice, Bitcoin wallets MUST prefer to use that instead.\n+\n+=== Records ===\n+Payment instructions are indexed by both a user and a domain. Instructions for a given `user` and `domain` are stored at `user`.user._bitcoin-payment.`domain` in a single TXT record.\n+\n+All payment instructions MUST be DNSSEC-signed.\n+\n+Payment instructions MAY resolve through CNAME or DNAME records as long as all relevant records are DNSSEC signed.\n+\n+User and domain names which are not expressible using standard printable ASCII MUST be encoded using the punycode IDN encoding defined in [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3492|RFC 3492]] and [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5891|RFC 5891]].\n+\n+=== Resolution ===\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST ignore any TXT records at the same label which do not begin with (ignoring case) \"bitcoin:\". Resolvers encountering multiple \"bitcoin:\"-matching TXT records at the same label MUST treat the records as invalid and refuse to use any payment instructions therein.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST fully validate DNSSEC signatures leading to the DNS root (including any relevant CNAME or DNAME records) and MUST NOT accept DNSSEC signatures which use SHA-1 or RSA with keys shorter than 1024 bits. Resolvers MAY accept SHA-1 DS records.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST NOT trust a remote resolver to validate DNSSEC records on their behalf.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST support resolving through CNAME or DNAME records.\n+\n+Resolvers MAY support resolving non-ASCII user and domain identifiers. Resolvers which do support non-ASCII user and domain identifiers MUST take precautions to prevent homograph attacks and SHOULD consider denying paste functionality when entering non-ASCII identifiers.\n+\n+=== Address Reuse ===\n+Payment instructions with on-chain addresses SHOULD be rotated as regularly as possible to reduce address reuse. In cases where this is not practical, payment instructions SHOULD NOT contain on-chain addresses (i.e. the URI path SHOULD be empty).\n+\n+== Rationale ==\n+\n+There are many existing schemes to resolve human-readable names to cryptocurrency payment instructions. Sadly, these current schemes suffer from a myriad of drawbacks, including (a) lacking succinct proofs of namespace to public key mappings, (b) revealing sender IP addresses to recipients or other intermediaries as a side-effect of payment, (c) relying on the bloated TLS Certificate Authority infrastructure, or (d) lacking open access, not allowing anyone to create a namespace mapping.\n+\n+=== DNS Rather than blockchain-based solutions ===\n+There are many blockchain-based alternatives to the DNS which feature better censorship-resistance and, in many cases, security. However, here we chose to use the standard ICANN-managed DNS namespace as many blockchain-based schemes suffer from (a), above (though in some cases this could be addressed with cryptographic SNARK schemes). Further, because they do not have simple client-side querying ability, many of these schemes use trusted intermediaries which resolve names on behalf of clients. This reintroduces drawbacks (b) and often (c) as well.\n+\n+Finally, its worth noting that none of the blockchain-based alternatives to the DNS have had material adoption outside of their specific silos, and committing Bitcoin wallets to rely on a separate system which doesn't see broad adoption may not be sustainable.\n+\n+=== DNS Rather than HTTP-based solutions ===\n+HTTP(s)-based payment instruction resolution protocols suffer from drawbacks (a), (b), and (c), above, and generally shouldn't be considered a serious alternative for payment instruction resolution.\n+\n+=== Private DNS Querying ===\n+While public recursive DNS resolvers are very common (e.g. 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8, and 9.9.9.9), using such resolvers directly (even after validating DNSSEC signatures) introduces drawback (b), at least in regard to a centralized intermediary. Resolving payment instructions recursively locally would instead introduce drawback (b) directly to the recipient, which may well be worse.\n+\n+For payers not using VPN or other proxying technologies, they generally trust their ISP for protection against denial of service anyway, so using ISP-provided recursive DNS resolvers is sufficient.\n+\n+However, for the best privacy, payers are encouraged to perform DNS resolution over Tor or another VPN technology.\n+\n+Lightning payers should consider utilizing DNS resolution over native onion messages, using the protocol described in [[BLIP 32|https://github.com/lightning/blips/blob/master/blip-0032.md]]\n+\n+== Examples ==\n+\n+`matt@mattcorallo.com` resolves to\n+`matt.user._bitcoin-payment.mattcorallo.com. 3600 IN TXT\t\"bitcoin:?b12=lno1qsgqmqvgm96frzdg8m0gc6nzeqffvzsqzrxqy32afmr3jn9ggkwg3egfwch2hy0l6jut6vfd8vpsc3h89l6u3dm4q2d6nuamav3w27xvdmv3lpgklhg7l5teypqz9l53hj7zvuaenh34xqsz2sa967yzqkylfu9xtcd5ymcmfp32h083e805y7jfd236w9afhavqqvl8uyma7x77yun4ehe9pnhu2gekjguexmxpqjcr2j822xr7q34p078gzslf9wpwz5y57alxu99s0z2ql0kfqvwhzycqq45ehh58xnfpuek80hw6spvwrvttjrrq9pphh0dpydh06qqspp5uq4gpyt6n9mwexde44qv7lstzzq60nr40ff38u27un6y53aypmx0p4qruk2tf9mjwqlhxak4znvna5y\"`",

Using DNSSEC, the DNS provides cryptographic guarantees using a straightforward PKI which follows the hierarchical nature of the DNS, allowing for stateless and even offline validation of DNS records from a single trusted root.\n+\n+Further, because DNS queries are generally proxied through ISP-provided or other resolvers, DNS queries usually do not directly expose the queryer's IP address. Further, because of the prevalence of open resolvers, the simplicity of the protocol, and broad availability of DNS recursive resolver implementations, finding a proxy for DNS records is trivial.\n+\n+Thus, using TXT records to store Bitcoin payment instructions allows for human-readable Bitcoin payment destinations which can be trivially verified on hardware wallets and which can be resolved relatively privately.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+=== General rules for handling ===\n+Bitcoin wallets MUST NOT prefer to use DNS-based resolving when methods with explicit public keys are available. In other words, if a standard Bitcoin address or direct BIP 21 URI is available or would suffice, Bitcoin wallets MUST prefer to use that instead.\n+\n+=== Records ===\n+Payment instructions are indexed by both a user and a domain. Instructions for a given `user` and `domain` are stored at `user`.user._bitcoin-payment.`domain` in a single TXT record.\n+\n+All payment instructions MUST be DNSSEC-signed.\n+\n+Payment instructions MAY resolve through CNAME or DNAME records as long as all relevant records are DNSSEC signed.\n+\n+User and domain names which are not expressible using standard printable ASCII MUST be encoded using the punycode IDN encoding defined in [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3492|RFC 3492]] and [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5891|RFC 5891]].\n+\n+=== Resolution ===\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST ignore any TXT records at the same label which do not begin with (ignoring case) \"bitcoin:\". Resolvers encountering multiple \"bitcoin:\"-matching TXT records at the same label MUST treat the records as invalid and refuse to use any payment instructions therein.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST fully validate DNSSEC signatures leading to the DNS root (including any relevant CNAME or DNAME records) and MUST NOT accept DNSSEC signatures which use SHA-1 or RSA with keys shorter than 1024 bits. Resolvers MAY accept SHA-1 DS records.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST NOT trust a remote resolver to validate DNSSEC records on their behalf.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST support resolving through CNAME or DNAME records.\n+\n+Resolvers MAY support resolving non-ASCII user and domain identifiers. Resolvers which do support non-ASCII user and domain identifiers MUST take precautions to prevent homograph attacks and SHOULD consider denying paste functionality when entering non-ASCII identifiers.\n+\n+=== Address Reuse ===\n+Payment instructions with on-chain addresses SHOULD be rotated as regularly as possible to reduce address reuse. In cases where this is not practical, payment instructions SHOULD NOT contain on-chain addresses (i.e. the URI path SHOULD be empty).\n+\n+== Rationale ==\n+\n+There are many existing schemes to resolve human-readable names to cryptocurrency payment instructions. Sadly, these current schemes suffer from a myriad of drawbacks, including (a) lacking succinct proofs of namespace to public key mappings, (b) revealing sender IP addresses to recipients or other intermediaries as a side-effect of payment, (c) relying on the bloated TLS Certificate Authority infrastructure, or (d) lacking open access, not allowing anyone to create a namespace mapping.\n+\n+=== DNS Rather than blockchain-based solutions ===\n+There are many blockchain-based alternatives to the DNS which feature better censorship-resistance and, in many cases, security. However, here we chose to use the standard ICANN-managed DNS namespace as many blockchain-based schemes suffer from (a), above (though in some cases this could be addressed with cryptographic SNARK schemes). Further, because they do not have simple client-side querying ability, many of these schemes use trusted intermediaries which resolve names on behalf of clients. This reintroduces drawbacks (b) and often (c) as well.\n+\n+Finally, its worth noting that none of the blockchain-based alternatives to the DNS have had material adoption outside of their specific silos, and committing Bitcoin wallets to rely on a separate system which doesn't see broad adoption may not be sustainable.\n+\n+=== DNS Rather than HTTP-based solutions ===\n+HTTP(s)-based payment instruction resolution protocols suffer from drawbacks (a), (b), and (c), above, and generally shouldn't be considered a serious alternative for payment instruction resolution.\n+\n+=== Private DNS Querying ===\n+While public recursive DNS resolvers are very common (e.g. 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8, and 9.9.9.9), using such resolvers directly (even after validating DNSSEC signatures) introduces drawback (b), at least in regard to a centralized intermediary. Resolving payment instructions recursively locally would instead introduce drawback (b) directly to the recipient, which may well be worse.\n+\n+For payers not using VPN or other proxying technologies, they generally trust their ISP for protection against denial of service anyway, so using ISP-provided recursive DNS resolvers is sufficient.\n+\n+However, for the best privacy, payers are encouraged to perform DNS resolution over Tor or another VPN technology.\n+\n+Lightning payers should consider utilizing DNS resolution over native onion messages, using the protocol described in [[BLIP 32|https://github.com/lightning/blips/blob/master/blip-0032.md]]\n+\n+== Examples ==\n+\n+`matt@mattcorallo.com` resolves to\n+`matt.user._bitcoin-payment.mattcorallo.com. 3600 IN TXT\t\"bitcoin:?b12=lno1qsgqmqvgm96frzdg8m0gc6nzeqffvzsqzrxqy32afmr3jn9ggkwg3egfwch2hy0l6jut6vfd8vpsc3h89l6u3dm4q2d6nuamav3w27xvdmv3lpgklhg7l5teypqz9l53hj7zvuaenh34xqsz2sa967yzqkylfu9xtcd5ymcmfp32h083e805y7jfd236w9afhavqqvl8uyma7x77yun4ehe9pnhu2gekjguexmxpqjcr2j822xr7q34p078gzslf9wpwz5y57alxu99s0z2ql0kfqvwhzycqq45ehh58xnfpuek80hw6spvwrvttjrrq9pphh0dpydh06qqspp5uq4gpyt6n9mwexde44qv7lstzzq60nr40ff38u27un6y53aypmx0p4qruk2tf9mjwqlhxak4znvna5y\"`",

Using DNSSEC, the DNS provides cryptographic guarantees using a straightforward PKI which follows the hierarchical nature of the DNS, allowing for stateless and even offline validation of DNS records from a single trusted root.\n+\n+Further, because DNS queries are generally proxied through ISP-provided or other resolvers, DNS queries usually do not directly expose the queryer's IP address. Further, because of the prevalence of open resolvers, the simplicity of the protocol, and broad availability of DNS recursive resolver implementations, finding a proxy for DNS records is trivial.\n+\n+Thus, using TXT records to store Bitcoin payment instructions allows for human-readable Bitcoin payment destinations which can be trivially verified on hardware wallets and which can be resolved relatively privately.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+=== General rules for handling ===\n+Bitcoin wallets MUST NOT prefer to use DNS-based resolving when methods with explicit public keys are available. In other words, if a standard Bitcoin address or direct BIP 21 URI is available or would suffice, Bitcoin wallets MUST prefer to use that instead.\n+\n+=== Records ===\n+Payment instructions are indexed by both a user and a domain. Instructions for a given `user` and `domain` are stored at `user`.user._bitcoin-payment.`domain` in a single TXT record.\n+\n+All payment instructions MUST be DNSSEC-signed.\n+\n+Payment instructions MAY resolve through CNAME or DNAME records as long as all relevant records are DNSSEC signed.\n+\n+User and domain names which are not expressible using standard printable ASCII MUST be encoded using the punycode IDN encoding defined in [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3492|RFC 3492]] and [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5891|RFC 5891]].\n+\n+=== Resolution ===\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST ignore any TXT records at the same label which do not begin with (ignoring case) \"bitcoin:\". Resolvers encountering multiple \"bitcoin:\"-matching TXT records at the same label MUST treat the records as invalid and refuse to use any payment instructions therein.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST fully validate DNSSEC signatures leading to the DNS root (including any relevant CNAME or DNAME records) and MUST NOT accept DNSSEC signatures which use SHA-1 or RSA with keys shorter than 1024 bits. Resolvers MAY accept SHA-1 DS records.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST NOT trust a remote resolver to validate DNSSEC records on their behalf.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST support resolving through CNAME or DNAME records.\n+\n+Resolvers MAY support resolving non-ASCII user and domain identifiers. Resolvers which do support non-ASCII user and domain identifiers MUST take precautions to prevent homograph attacks and SHOULD consider denying paste functionality when entering non-ASCII identifiers.\n+\n+=== Address Reuse ===\n+Payment instructions with on-chain addresses SHOULD be rotated as regularly as possible to reduce address reuse. In cases where this is not practical, payment instructions SHOULD NOT contain on-chain addresses (i.e. the URI path SHOULD be empty).\n+\n+== Rationale ==\n+\n+There are many existing schemes to resolve human-readable names to cryptocurrency payment instructions. Sadly, these current schemes suffer from a myriad of drawbacks, including (a) lacking succinct proofs of namespace to public key mappings, (b) revealing sender IP addresses to recipients or other intermediaries as a side-effect of payment, (c) relying on the bloated TLS Certificate Authority infrastructure, or (d) lacking open access, not allowing anyone to create a namespace mapping.\n+\n+=== DNS Rather than blockchain-based solutions ===\n+There are many blockchain-based alternatives to the DNS which feature better censorship-resistance and, in many cases, security. However, here we chose to use the standard ICANN-managed DNS namespace as many blockchain-based schemes suffer from (a), above (though in some cases this could be addressed with cryptographic SNARK schemes). Further, because they do not have simple client-side querying ability, many of these schemes use trusted intermediaries which resolve names on behalf of clients. This reintroduces drawbacks (b) and often (c) as well.\n+\n+Finally, its worth noting that none of the blockchain-based alternatives to the DNS have had material adoption outside of their specific silos, and committing Bitcoin wallets to rely on a separate system which doesn't see broad adoption may not be sustainable.\n+\n+=== DNS Rather than HTTP-based solutions ===\n+HTTP(s)-based payment instruction resolution protocols suffer from drawbacks (a), (b), and (c), above, and generally shouldn't be considered a serious alternative for payment instruction resolution.\n+\n+=== Private DNS Querying ===\n+While public recursive DNS resolvers are very common (e.g. 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8, and 9.9.9.9), using such resolvers directly (even after validating DNSSEC signatures) introduces drawback (b), at least in regard to a centralized intermediary. Resolving payment instructions recursively locally would instead introduce drawback (b) directly to the recipient, which may well be worse.\n+\n+For payers not using VPN or other proxying technologies, they generally trust their ISP for protection against denial of service anyway, so using ISP-provided recursive DNS resolvers is sufficient.\n+\n+However, for the best privacy, payers are encouraged to perform DNS resolution over Tor or another VPN technology.\n+\n+Lightning payers should consider utilizing DNS resolution over native onion messages, using the protocol described in [[BLIP 32|https://github.com/lightning/blips/blob/master/blip-0032.md]]\n+\n+== Examples ==\n+\n+`matt@mattcorallo.com` resolves to\n+`matt.user._bitcoin-payment.mattcorallo.com. 3600 IN TXT\t\"bitcoin:?b12=lno1qsgqmqvgm96frzdg8m0gc6nzeqffvzsqzrxqy32afmr3jn9ggkwg3egfwch2hy0l6jut6vfd8vpsc3h89l6u3dm4q2d6nuamav3w27xvdmv3lpgklhg7l5teypqz9l53hj7zvuaenh34xqsz2sa967yzqkylfu9xtcd5ymcmfp32h083e805y7jfd236w9afhavqqvl8uyma7x77yun4ehe9pnhu2gekjguexmxpqjcr2j822xr7q34p078gzslf9wpwz5y57alxu99s0z2ql0kfqvwhzycqq45ehh58xnfpuek80hw6spvwrvttjrrq9pphh0dpydh06qqspp5uq4gpyt6n9mwexde44qv7lstzzq60nr40ff38u27un6y53aypmx0p4qruk2tf9mjwqlhxak4znvna5y\"`",

Using DNSSEC, the DNS provides cryptographic guarantees using a straightforward PKI which follows the hierarchical nature of the DNS, allowing for stateless and even offline validation of DNS records from a single trusted root.\n+\n+Further, because DNS queries are generally proxied through ISP-provided or other resolvers, DNS queries usually do not directly expose the queryer's IP address. Further, because of the prevalence of open resolvers, the simplicity of the protocol, and broad availability of DNS recursive resolver implementations, finding a proxy for DNS records is trivial.\n+\n+Thus, using TXT records to store Bitcoin payment instructions allows for human-readable Bitcoin payment destinations which can be trivially verified on hardware wallets and which can be resolved relatively privately.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+=== General rules for handling ===\n+Bitcoin wallets MUST NOT prefer to use DNS-based resolving when methods with explicit public keys are available. In other words, if a standard Bitcoin address or direct BIP 21 URI is available or would suffice, Bitcoin wallets MUST prefer to use that instead.\n+\n+=== Records ===\n+Payment instructions are indexed by both a user and a domain. Instructions for a given `user` and `domain` are stored at `user`.user._bitcoin-payment.`domain` in a single TXT record.\n+\n+All payment instructions MUST be DNSSEC-signed.\n+\n+Payment instructions MAY resolve through CNAME or DNAME records as long as all relevant records are DNSSEC signed.\n+\n+User and domain names which are not expressible using standard printable ASCII MUST be encoded using the punycode IDN encoding defined in [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3492|RFC 3492]] and [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5891|RFC 5891]].\n+\n+=== Resolution ===\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST ignore any TXT records at the same label which do not begin with (ignoring case) \"bitcoin:\". Resolvers encountering multiple \"bitcoin:\"-matching TXT records at the same label MUST treat the records as invalid and refuse to use any payment instructions therein.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST fully validate DNSSEC signatures leading to the DNS root (including any relevant CNAME or DNAME records) and MUST NOT accept DNSSEC signatures which use SHA-1 or RSA with keys shorter than 1024 bits. Resolvers MAY accept SHA-1 DS records.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST NOT trust a remote resolver to validate DNSSEC records on their behalf.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST support resolving through CNAME or DNAME records.\n+\n+Resolvers MAY support resolving non-ASCII user and domain identifiers. Resolvers which do support non-ASCII user and domain identifiers MUST take precautions to prevent homograph attacks and SHOULD consider denying paste functionality when entering non-ASCII identifiers.\n+\n+=== Address Reuse ===\n+Payment instructions with on-chain addresses SHOULD be rotated as regularly as possible to reduce address reuse. In cases where this is not practical, payment instructions SHOULD NOT contain on-chain addresses (i.e. the URI path SHOULD be empty).\n+\n+== Rationale ==\n+\n+There are many existing schemes to resolve human-readable names to cryptocurrency payment instructions. Sadly, these current schemes suffer from a myriad of drawbacks, including (a) lacking succinct proofs of namespace to public key mappings, (b) revealing sender IP addresses to recipients or other intermediaries as a side-effect of payment, (c) relying on the bloated TLS Certificate Authority infrastructure, or (d) lacking open access, not allowing anyone to create a namespace mapping.\n+\n+=== DNS Rather than blockchain-based solutions ===\n+There are many blockchain-based alternatives to the DNS which feature better censorship-resistance and, in many cases, security. However, here we chose to use the standard ICANN-managed DNS namespace as many blockchain-based schemes suffer from (a), above (though in some cases this could be addressed with cryptographic SNARK schemes). Further, because they do not have simple client-side querying ability, many of these schemes use trusted intermediaries which resolve names on behalf of clients. This reintroduces drawbacks (b) and often (c) as well.\n+\n+Finally, its worth noting that none of the blockchain-based alternatives to the DNS have had material adoption outside of their specific silos, and committing Bitcoin wallets to rely on a separate system which doesn't see broad adoption may not be sustainable.\n+\n+=== DNS Rather than HTTP-based solutions ===\n+HTTP(s)-based payment instruction resolution protocols suffer from drawbacks (a), (b), and (c), above, and generally shouldn't be considered a serious alternative for payment instruction resolution.\n+\n+=== Private DNS Querying ===\n+While public recursive DNS resolvers are very common (e.g. 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8, and 9.9.9.9), using such resolvers directly (even after validating DNSSEC signatures) introduces drawback (b), at least in regard to a centralized intermediary. Resolving payment instructions recursively locally would instead introduce drawback (b) directly to the recipient, which may well be worse.\n+\n+For payers not using VPN or other proxying technologies, they generally trust their ISP for protection against denial of service anyway, so using ISP-provided recursive DNS resolvers is sufficient.\n+\n+However, for the best privacy, payers are encouraged to perform DNS resolution over Tor or another VPN technology.\n+\n+Lightning payers should consider utilizing DNS resolution over native onion messages, using the protocol described in [[BLIP 32|https://github.com/lightning/blips/blob/master/blip-0032.md]]",

Using DNSSEC, the DNS provides cryptographic guarantees using a straightforward PKI which follows the hierarchical nature of the DNS, allowing for stateless and even offline validation of DNS records from a single trusted root.\n+\n+Further, because DNS queries are generally proxied through ISP-provided or other resolvers, DNS queries usually do not directly expose the queryer's IP address. Further, because of the prevalence of open resolvers, the simplicity of the protocol, and broad availability of DNS recursive resolver implementations, finding a proxy for DNS records is trivial.\n+\n+Thus, using TXT records to store Bitcoin payment instructions allows for human-readable Bitcoin payment destinations which can be trivially verified on hardware wallets and which can be resolved relatively privately.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+=== General rules for handling ===\n+Bitcoin wallets MUST NOT prefer to use DNS-based resolving when methods with explicit public keys are available. In other words, if a standard Bitcoin address or direct BIP 21 URI is available or would suffice, Bitcoin wallets MUST prefer to use that instead.\n+\n+=== Records ===\n+Payment instructions are indexed by both a user and a domain. Instructions for a given `user` and `domain` are stored at `user`.user._bitcoin-payment.`domain` in a single TXT record.\n+\n+All payment instructions MUST be DNSSEC-signed.\n+\n+Payment instructions MAY resolve through CNAME or DNAME records as long as all relevant records are DNSSEC signed.\n+\n+User and domain names which are not expressible using standard printable ASCII MUST be encoded using the punycode IDN encoding defined in [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3492|RFC 3492]] and [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5891|RFC 5891]].\n+\n+=== Resolution ===\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST ignore any TXT records at the same label which do not begin with (ignoring case) \"bitcoin:\". Resolvers encountering multiple \"bitcoin:\"-matching TXT records at the same label MUST treat the records as invalid and refuse to use any payment instructions therein.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST fully validate DNSSEC signatures leading to the DNS root (including any relevant CNAME or DNAME records) and MUST NOT accept DNSSEC signatures which use SHA-1 or RSA with keys shorter than 1024 bits. Resolvers MAY accept SHA-1 DS records.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST NOT trust a remote resolver to validate DNSSEC records on their behalf.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST support resolving through CNAME or DNAME records.\n+\n+Resolvers MAY support resolving non-ASCII user and domain identifiers. Resolvers which do support non-ASCII user and domain identifiers MUST take precautions to prevent homograph attacks and SHOULD consider denying paste functionality when entering non-ASCII identifiers.\n+\n+=== Address Reuse ===\n+Payment instructions with on-chain addresses SHOULD be rotated as regularly as possible to reduce address reuse. In cases where this is not practical, payment instructions SHOULD NOT contain on-chain addresses (i.e. the URI path SHOULD be empty).\n+\n+== Rationale ==\n+\n+There are many existing schemes to resolve human-readable names to cryptocurrency payment instructions. Sadly, these current schemes suffer from a myriad of drawbacks, including (a) lacking succinct proofs of namespace to public key mappings, (b) revealing sender IP addresses to recipients or other intermediaries as a side-effect of payment, (c) relying on the bloated TLS Certificate Authority infrastructure, or (d) lacking open access, not allowing anyone to create a namespace mapping.\n+\n+=== DNS Rather than blockchain-based solutions ===\n+There are many blockchain-based alternatives to the DNS which feature better censorship-resistance and, in many cases, security. However, here we chose to use the standard ICANN-managed DNS namespace as many blockchain-based schemes suffer from (a), above (though in some cases this could be addressed with cryptographic SNARK schemes). Further, because they do not have simple client-side querying ability, many of these schemes use trusted intermediaries which resolve names on behalf of clients. This reintroduces drawbacks (b) and often (c) as well.\n+\n+Finally, its worth noting that none of the blockchain-based alternatives to the DNS have had material adoption outside of their specific silos, and committing Bitcoin wallets to rely on a separate system which doesn't see broad adoption may not be sustainable.\n+\n+=== DNS Rather than HTTP-based solutions ===\n+HTTP(s)-based payment instruction resolution protocols suffer from drawbacks (a), (b), and (c), above, and generally shouldn't be considered a serious alternative for payment instruction resolution.\n+\n+=== Private DNS Querying ===\n+While public recursive DNS resolvers are very common (e.g. 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8, and 9.9.9.9), using such resolvers directly (even after validating DNSSEC signatures) introduces drawback (b), at least in regard to a centralized intermediary. Resolving payment instructions recursively locally would instead introduce drawback (b) directly to the recipient, which may well be worse.\n+\n+For payers not using VPN or other proxying technologies, they generally trust their ISP for protection against denial of service anyway, so using ISP-provided recursive DNS resolvers is sufficient.\n+\n+However, for the best privacy, payers are encouraged to perform DNS resolution over Tor or another VPN technology.\n+\n+Lightning payers should consider utilizing DNS resolution over native onion messages, using the protocol described in [[BLIP 32|https://github.com/lightning/blips/blob/master/blip-0032.md]]",

Using DNSSEC, the DNS provides cryptographic guarantees using a straightforward PKI which follows the hierarchical nature of the DNS, allowing for stateless and even offline validation of DNS records from a single trusted root.\n+\n+Further, because DNS queries are generally proxied through ISP-provided or other resolvers, DNS queries usually do not directly expose the queryer's IP address. Further, because of the prevalence of open resolvers, the simplicity of the protocol, and broad availability of DNS recursive resolver implementations, finding a proxy for DNS records is trivial.\n+\n+Thus, using TXT records to store Bitcoin payment instructions allows for human-readable Bitcoin payment destinations which can be trivially verified on hardware wallets and which can be resolved relatively privately.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+=== General rules for handling ===\n+Bitcoin wallets MUST NOT prefer to use DNS-based resolving when methods with explicit public keys are available. In other words, if a standard Bitcoin address or direct BIP 21 URI is available or would suffice, Bitcoin wallets MUST prefer to use that instead.\n+\n+=== Records ===\n+Payment instructions are indexed by both a user and a domain. Instructions for a given `user` and `domain` are stored at `user`.user._bitcoin-payment.`domain` in a single TXT record.\n+\n+All payment instructions MUST be DNSSEC-signed.\n+\n+Payment instructions MAY resolve through CNAME or DNAME records as long as all relevant records are DNSSEC signed.\n+\n+User and domain names which are not expressible using standard printable ASCII MUST be encoded using the punycode IDN encoding defined in [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3492|RFC 3492]] and [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5891|RFC 5891]].\n+\n+=== Resolution ===\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST ignore any TXT records at the same label which do not begin with (ignoring case) \"bitcoin:\". Resolvers encountering multiple \"bitcoin:\"-matching TXT records at the same label MUST treat the records as invalid and refuse to use any payment instructions therein.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST fully validate DNSSEC signatures leading to the DNS root (including any relevant CNAME or DNAME records) and MUST NOT accept DNSSEC signatures which use SHA-1 or RSA with keys shorter than 1024 bits. Resolvers MAY accept SHA-1 DS records.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST NOT trust a remote resolver to validate DNSSEC records on their behalf.\n+\n+Clients resolving Bitcoin payment instructions MUST support resolving through CNAME or DNAME records.\n+\n+Resolvers MAY support resolving non-ASCII user and domain identifiers. Resolvers which do support non-ASCII user and domain identifiers MUST take precautions to prevent homograph attacks and SHOULD consider denying paste functionality when entering non-ASCII identifiers.\n+\n+=== Address Reuse ===\n+Payment instructions with on-chain addresses SHOULD be rotated as regularly as possible to reduce address reuse. In cases where this is not practical, payment instructions SHOULD NOT contain on-chain addresses (i.e. the URI path SHOULD be empty).",

Downsides / blockers could be:\r\n\r\n- if it is generated on the fly during e.g. a deposit action on an exchange or a shop checkout of a merchant, the TXT record might not propagate quickly enough for the lookup to succeed\r\n- publishing a new address after the previous one has been used also might not propagate in time to prevent re-using an address\r\n- bad privacy for the merchant/exchange\r\n- not quite sure if it is practical to have a lot of txt records for services that serve a lot of users\r\n\r\n",
