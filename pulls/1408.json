    "body": "Ordinal numbers are serial numbers for sats, assigned when mined and preserved across transactions.\r\n\r\nI originally posted an earlier draft of the BIP to [bitcoin-dev](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-February/019975.html) in February of last year.\r\n\r\nWe've implemented a wallet and block explorer, with public instances on [mainnet](http://ordinals.com/), [signet](http://signet.ordinals.com/), and [testnet](https://testnet.ordinals.com), and a [wallet](https://github.com/casey/ord) that uses sat control to ensure specific sats are transferred to specific outputs. Constructing such transactions is tricky, especially given the dust limit and doing proper fee estimation, but once you get the details right it works well, and the fact that such transactions are otherwise normal Bitcoin transactions means that existing bitcoin infrastructure can be leveraged.\r\n\r\nSince we've been using ordinal numbers in production and getting some users of the software it seemed appropriate to request a BIP number.\r\n\r\nI've never applied for a BIP number before, so definitely let me know if anything should be changed or can be improved!",

      "body": "> @junderw: It has been discussed previously by at least one BIP editor that BOLTs could potentially become BIPs in future. So BOLTs aren't in same bracket as Ethereum EIPs which are for a totally different blockchain. I'm not sure about the history on SLIPs. It seems to me that some of those could have possibly been BIPs too and perhaps could be in future.\r\n\r\nBOLTs should stay separate. It has grown into something that would ideally have its own proposals.\r\n\r\n> I get why people don't like this proposal but there are other BIPs that are disliked too and we should try to be consistent with the guidelines from BIP 2 of what should and shouldn't be a BIP even if we dislike a particular proposal.\r\n\r\n- API/RPC and application layer BIPs must be implemented by at least two independent and compatible software applications: Nope, only 1\r\n- Useful to a reasonable amount of Bitcoin users: no\r\n- also that this is widely rejected",

An accepted BIP does not indicate endorsement by the BIP repo maintainers, Bitcoin Core, or the larger Bitcoin community.\n\nA BIP is more akin to a form of technical documentation or standard.\n\nSimilarly, a BIP number is also not an endorsement, merely an identifier which allows the Bitcoin community to more easily reference and discuss the BIP in question.\n\nA lot of the comments here are off topic, according to my understanding of this repo's purpose.\n\nIf my understanding is wrong, please let me know, and I'll close this PR!",

      "body": "> for data storage (which was not an intended use case, and any ways to do that were limited, like OP_RETURN being capped at 80 bytes)\r\n\r\n@Semisol  It was not actually limited in practice, since customers of miners' blockspace have been storing arbitrary data in Bitcoin via p2ms regardless, due to the lack of OP_RETURN flexibility, which was worse for Bitcoin than OP_RETURN (occupied nodes' RAM), yet done anyway because \"you cannot stop the free market\"; if you try, you will end up with sub-optimal outcomes and an inefficient market. Inscriptions is better than the real alternative of p2ms, and so is an improvement even in just this simple way to Bitcoin's functioning.\r\n\r\nArbitrary data (with its inherent mix of pros and cons) has been stored in Bitcoin throughout its history, prior to Inscriptions, so Inscriptions is really nothing new:\r\n\r\n1. http://www.righto.com/2014/02/ascii-bernanke-wikileaks-photographs.html\r\n2. https://ourbigbook.com/cirosantilli/cool-data-embedded-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain\r\n3. https://fc18.ifca.ai/preproceedings/6.pdf\r\n\r\n> It's not something a subset of people \"don't like\" -- it is misuse of the network, which was meant for financial transactions (the whitepaper, name and code point to this)\r\n\r\n@Semisol  However, it is exactly about what people do not like, and it is exactly not a misuse of the network.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the market demand (fee market is competitive, fee rate determines priority; if the non-financial tx with higher fee rate outcompetes the financial tx with lower fee rate, then this is the free market speaking about where real economic value lies, as an example) is what actually determines for which use the miners sell their finite blockspace to their customers (those paying for transactions) -- and is what determines good/desirable vs. bad/undesirable/spam/nonsense/stupid/etc. The individual opinion of someone is not what determines which uses are valid or invalid, as of course it is the miners who \"own\" that blockspace, so it is only the miners who make that determination (and if users for example try to stop nodes from relaying certain transactions to miners, ahem, it only incentivizes miners to create alternative channels for users to directly send transactions to miners, which as you may imagine creates all kinds of unintended consequences that are bad for Bitcoin -- you must remember the bottom line realities of the network, upon which the unstoppable free market operates, in order to avoid making mistakes that make what is seen as a problem become even worse).\r\n\r\nMiners are incentivized to increase their total revenue per block, as a course of normal business, and also as they try to offset their exponentially-declining subsidy revenue (which is meant to be replaced with fee revenue, hence the name 'subsidy'). As such, miners do not care to pass moral or any other such judgement to choose to censor technically-valid bitcoin transactions (and since Bitcoin is supposed to be a censorship-resistant network, we would hope so!).\r\n\r\nAt best, Bitcoin is designed so that miners simply behave as rational economic actors, which means they should be optimizing their fee revenue, which in turn is good for Bitcoin as it encourages censorship-resistance, and also increases Bitcoin's \"security budget\" (relevant when considering Bitcoin inherently exists in an adversarial environment in which hostile hashrate must be assumed to exist) -- by encouraging higher-fee transactions that are economically meaningful on the base layer (this is what determines 'value', not any moral or other judgment).\r\n\r\nAnything that increases demand for Bitcoin's supply of blockspace, thus allowing bocks to be filled with a floor of lower fee-rate transactions to create a competitive fee-rate market, acts to boost fee-rate pressure, thus helping to increase the **fee-to-subsidy ratio of each block and improving Bitcoin's security**. Since security is the number 1 priority of any Bitcoin user, without which everything else is irrelevant, the number 1 priority should be to boost demand for blockspace.\r\n\r\nInscriptions simply popularizes another demand for blockspace (arbitrary data stored by customers desiring the best decentralized network on Earth), beyond the existing demands from SoV (store of value) and MoE (medium of exchange) (low-value high-volume MoE transactions go on second layers, high-value low-volume MoE transactions go on base layer) uses that so far have not been sufficient to reliably fill blocks & generate enough fee pressure to offset the subsidy (fee-to-subsidy ratio of 100%).\r\n\r\nInscriptions theoretically (and so far in practice, however the fee-to-subsidy ratio of each blocks is still only 3.5%, since this only picked up steam 2 weeks ago) achieves this boost in blockspace demand by filling blocks and increasing economic activity on the base layer (vs. the last 1.5 years that have been marred with many non-full blocks and thus paltry fees -- objectively bad from the point of view of network security), thus objectively it is not a misuse of the network, and rather it is \"good for bitcoin\" for anyone who cares about Bitcoin's security and security sustainability (vis a vis the hashrate sustaining itself without the exponentially-declining subsidy), and who is able and willing to truly appreciate what a censorship-resistant network requires to function successfully in an adversarial environment. Really, it is a matter of being focused on priorities, so that the number 1 priority of security and security sustainability is able to rise in your mind to the top of consideration (over lesser considerations of judging uses as 'good' vs. 'bad'/'nonsense'/'spam').\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I have not used Inscriptions nor do I intend to use it anytime soon, so I am not speaking in my own interest, I am only speaking in the interest of Bitcoin.",

      "body": "> Eliminating fungibility and enabling new types of tracking across transactions is not a feature, but a bug to be fixed.\r\n\r\n@vikbtc  From my understanding, this is actually FUD.\r\n\r\nThe Ordinals system is voluntary, and it is a way of designating sats as having different numismatic value, based on fixed properties, so simplistically:\r\n\r\n1. rarest\r\n2. rarer\r\n3. rare\r\n4. unrare\r\n5. unrarer\r\n6. unrarest\r\n\r\nThis classification doesn’t make sats less fungible, since it’s only judging based on “rarity”, with the idea to add numismatic market value on top of the underlying bitcoin market value of the sats. It does not make sense to not accept sats on basis of rarity labeling, so it doesn’t hurt fungibility.\r\n\r\nIt’s like fiat coins, which can all be judged numismatically on such a scale of “rarest” to “unrarest”. This aspect does not hurt fungibility of the coins, and it only potentially helps you with more value for the coins if you recognize the numismatic value of the coins.\r\n\r\nSo, Ordinals (system of having sats of different rarities) does not hurt you, only potentially helps you.\r\n\r\nNote: Ordinals and Inscriptions are two different things. I have commented about Inscriptions in my previous post.",

The author of this PR did submit a draft BIP on Feb 23 2022, but it garnered very little discussion. In fact, of the two devs who bothered to respond, one gave it an ACK and the other a NACK. This hardly qualifies as a discussion or vetting, and most certainly **not** a community consensus. \r\n\r\nSo instead of the author seeking further discussion or community feedback before opening a PR here, we find ordinals suddenly **live** on the mainnet around the same time that this PR is opened. That is literally not what the BIP workflow is about. This is akin to zero-day behavior.\r\n\r\nIf the author chooses not respect BIP guidelines and processes, why bother seeking a BIP number here? \r\n\r\nAssigning this PR a BIP number would send to the community a strong signal that BIP-2 is no longer relevant. \r\n\r\nHard NACK on BIP number assignment.\r\n\r\n",

Inscriptions is better than the real alternative of p2ms, and so is an improvement even in just this simple way to Bitcoin's functioning.\r\n> \r\n> Arbitrary data (with its inherent mix of pros and cons) has been stored in Bitcoin throughout its history, prior to Inscriptions, so Inscriptions is really nothing new:\r\n> \r\n> 1. http://www.righto.com/2014/02/ascii-bernanke-wikileaks-photographs.html\r\n> 2. https://ourbigbook.com/cirosantilli/cool-data-embedded-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain\r\n> 3. https://fc18.ifca.ai/preproceedings/6.pdf\r\n> \r\n> > It's not something a subset of people \"don't like\" -- it is misuse of the network, which was meant for financial transactions (the whitepaper, name and code point to this)\r\n> \r\n> @Semisol However, it is exactly about what people do not like, and it is exactly not a misuse of the network.\r\n> \r\n> In reality, the market demand (fee market is competitive, fee rate determines priority; if the non-financial tx with higher fee rate outcompetes the financial tx with lower fee rate, then this is the free market speaking about where real economic value lies, as an example) is what actually determines for which use the miners sell their finite blockspace to their customers (those paying for transactions) -- and is what determines good/desirable vs. bad/undesirable/spam/nonsense/stupid/etc. The individual opinion of someone is not what determines which uses are valid or invalid, as of course it is the miners who \"own\" that blockspace, so it is only the miners who make that determination (and if users for example try to stop nodes from relaying certain transactions to miners, ahem, it only incentivizes miners to create alternative channels for users to directly send transactions to miners, which as you may imagine creates all kinds of unintended consequences that are bad for Bitcoin -- you must remember the bottom line realities of the network, upon which the unstoppable free market operates, in order to avoid making mistakes that make what is seen as a problem become even worse).\r\n> \r\n> Miners are incentivized to increase their total revenue per block, as a course of normal business, and also as they try to offset their exponentially-declining subsidy revenue (which is meant to be replaced with fee revenue, hence the name 'subsidy'). As such, miners do not care to pass moral or any other such judgement to choose to censor technically-valid bitcoin transactions (and since Bitcoin is supposed to be a censorship-resistant network, we would hope so!).\r\n> \r\n> At best, Bitcoin is designed so that miners simply behave as rational economic actors, which means they should be optimizing their fee revenue, which in turn is good for Bitcoin as it encourages censorship-resistance, and also increases Bitcoin's \"security budget\" (relevant when considering Bitcoin inherently exists in an adversarial environment in which hostile hashrate must be assumed to exist) -- by encouraging higher-fee transactions that are economically meaningful on the base layer (this is what determines 'value', not any moral or other judgment).\r\n> \r\n> Anything that increases demand for Bitcoin's supply of blockspace, thus allowing bocks to be filled with a floor of lower fee-rate transactions to create a competitive fee-rate market, acts to boost fee-rate pressure, thus helping to increase the **fee-to-subsidy ratio of each block and improving Bitcoin's security**. Since security is the number 1 priority of any Bitcoin user, without which everything else is irrelevant, the number 1 priority should be to boost demand for blockspace.\r\n> \r\n> Inscriptions simply popularizes another demand for blockspace (arbitrary data stored by customers desiring the best decentralized network on Earth), beyond the existing demands from SoV (store of value) and MoE (medium of exchange) (low-value high-volume MoE transactions go on second layers, high-value low-volume MoE transactions go on base layer) uses that so far have not been sufficient to reliably fill blocks & generate enough fee pressure to offset the subsidy (fee-to-subsidy ratio of 100%).\r\n> \r\n> Inscriptions theoretically (and so far in practice, however the fee-to-subsidy ratio of each blocks is still only 3.5%, since this only picked up steam 2 weeks ago) achieves this boost in blockspace demand by filling blocks and increasing economic activity on the base layer (vs. the last 1.5 years that have been marred with many non-full blocks and thus paltry fees -- objectively bad from the point of view of network security), thus objectively it is not a misuse of the network, and rather it is \"good for bitcoin\" for anyone who cares about Bitcoin's security and security sustainability (vis a vis the hashrate sustaining itself without the exponentially-declining subsidy), and who is able and willing to truly appreciate what a censorship-resistant network requires to function successfully in an adversarial environment. Really, it is a matter of being focused on priorities, so that the number 1 priority of security and security sustainability is able to rise in your mind to the top of consideration (over lesser considerations of judging uses as 'good' vs. 'bad'/'nonsense'/'spam').\r\n> \r\n> Disclaimer: I have not used Inscriptions nor do I intend to use it anytime soon, so I am not speaking in my own interest, I am only speaking in the interest of Bitcoin.\r\n\r\n@eragmus:\r\nSpeaking also in the interest of Bitcoin and using BIP-0002: “[…] collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Bitcoin. The BIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.“, express following concern:\r\n\r\nWhat are the economical incentives for a rational actor to run a bitcoin Full-Node (if not running as Lightning-Node for whatever reason)?\r\n\r\nThis actor/role in the bitcoin network provides storage resource and verification processing (energy/time) mostly for free. If such kind of rational actors do not agree to provide storage for non-financial-transaction-bits (since once the e.g. 1 TB SSD is full, these actors will not buy a SSD of bigger capacity and provide this resource to the bitcoin network) then, they will change to run a Light-Node (to participate sovereignly in the network). This rational action could have the total effect to reduce the decentralization and security of the bitcoin network.\r\nMiner-actors can finance themselves OTC over the short/middle term. Although, over the long run the network could have its time counted.\r\n\r\nIt would be in interest of all the bitcoin network’s stakeholders to take decisions/actions in consensus and strengthen the incentives of Full-Node-Runners to provide storage resource. Focusing only on the economical/financial incentives of miner-actors ceteris paribus would destabilize the storage resources allocation, centralize and insecure the network against malicious actions/actors.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, as @luke-jr proposed: the autor of this proposal is encouraged to withdraw it and abandon it entirely. The autor of this proposal is free to pursue innovations and ideas in e.g. an OIP-0001 or the likes.",

A BIP number does have a meaning as discussed many times in previous comments. You are a correct in that being assigned one doesn't imply endorsement. There is a bar that needs to be met for a BIP number to be assigned if you read BIP 2 to ensure we don't get poor quality, nonsensical BIPs. BIP numbers are also convenient in the sense that the Taproot BIPs could have been 12345, 6839482 and 378957823 rather than BIP 340, 341 and 342. ",

      "body": "@michaelfolkson The issue is that misinformation-derived politics, due to various reasons (like emotional decision-making, appeal to authority of \"Satoshi vision\", and other weaknesses), has dominated this BIP discussion and polluted it. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, one can argue that anyone can participate, and so even if there is lots of noise, there is still some signal that comes through (related and unrelated to the BIP approval process). If it was an automatic BIP approval process, the mix of reactions wouldn't occur which, beside their value on their own, also means people wouldn't have an opportunity to learn more about the BIP and BIP process.\r\n\r\nSo, I think overall, maybe it is best to leave the process the way it is. It is messy, but the non-emotional people who understand the BIP process are still able to make the final decision (even if they, like Luke, push their personal, and IMO misguided, opinion on the BIP itself in their comments here, personal opinion which AFAIK is irrelevant to the BIP process).",

The BIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.“, express following concern:\r\n> \r\n> What are the economical incentives for a rational actor to run a bitcoin Full-Node (if not running as Lightning-Node for whatever reason)?\r\n> \r\n> This actor/role in the bitcoin network provides storage resource and verification processing (energy/time) mostly for free. \r\n\r\nThere are no direct financial incentives for a rational actor to run a Bitcoin full node, if not running a lightning node, as you suggested, since then the actor wouldn't receive any payment for running the full node.\r\n\r\nHowever, the runner of the full node presumably owns bitcoin, in which case it is in the runner's indirect financial interest that the Bitcoin network works well. Part of this includes doing their part to decentralize the network, which includes running the full node. So, it can be thought of a relatively tiny investment to help support their bitcoin investment, not to mention the various non-direct and non-indirect financial interests in running the full node for their own benefit.\r\n\r\n> If such kind of rational actors do not agree to provide storage for non-financial-transaction-bits (since once the e.g. 1 TB SSD is full, these actors will not buy a SSD of bigger capacity and provide this resource to the bitcoin network) then, they will change to run a Light-Node (to participate sovereignly in the network).\r\n\r\nWhat is the reason not to upgrade the 1 TB SSD, once full? Storage cost is one of which falls in price the fastest. The storage can only increase max about 210 GB per year, no further, and we are at about 550 GB, so that means at least 2 years more. By then, prices will likely have fallen even further (in 2 years, price for an example 2 TB SSD has fallen 63% from about $440 to $160 -- [https://3cmls.co/US/B08RK2SR23](https://3cmls.co/US/B08RK2SR23), so might be $60 in another 2 years, which would be 25% cheaper than the average price of 1 TB SSD now).\r\n\r\nAnd anyway, segwit already locked in the max of about 210 GB storage increase per year, and segwit had consensus, so this should be expected and supported and assumed by a runner of a full node, irrespective of the form the txs take ('normal' txs or arbitrary data txs).\r\n\r\nPlus, arbitrary data txs have already occurred throughout Bitcoin's history via p2ms, before Inscriptions-based arbitrary data ever became a thing, so this is not actually a new phenomenon. Full node runners have always hosted arbitrary data.\r\n\r\n> This rational action could have the total effect to reduce the decentralization and security of the bitcoin network.\r\n\r\nSure, everyone makes their own decisions, so full node runners must choose too. On the other hand, there have been reports from many that demand to run full nodes has jumped dramatically (one report indicated more demand to run full nodes in a matter of weeks/months recently than in prior 5 years total), so while there may be some loss due to ideological reasons, there may also be some gain due to new users entering Bitcoin. We will have to wait to see the full net effect on full nodes.\r\n \r\n> It would be in interest of all the bitcoin network’s stakeholders to take decisions/actions in consensus \r\n\r\nOrdinals and Inscriptions do not require consensus to operate. They are not forks of any kind. \r\n\r\nOrdinals are simply an arbitrary way of thinking about sats that categories sats into different levels of \"rarity\", like with the numismatic value of fiat coins. Meanwhile, Inscriptions are technically-valid Bitcoin txs that allow arbitrary data storage. Both are enabled via a custom wallet that lets one distinguish and work with sats, functionality that is required by both.\r\n\r\n> and strengthen the incentives of Full-Node-Runners to provide storage resource.\r\n\r\nAlready discussed previously in this message, so won't repeat.\r\n\r\n> Focusing only on the economical/financial incentives of miner-actors ceteris paribus \r\n\r\nJust to be clear, the miners are critical elements of the network, in terms of the security they provide. The full nodes' contribution to security is not even in the same realm as that provided by miners. It has always been known that the miners' compensation, via subsidy, is exponentially falling every 4 years, and so it requires to be compensated for by fees (generated by txs on the base layer). This means blocks should be full to generate fee pressure and a fee market, so that high-enough-fee rate txs (economically competitive txs) become the norm on the base layer. It is very very very important to focus on incentives of miners; it is IMO the most important element of the Bitcoin network, since without security everything falls apart.\r\n\r\n> would destabilize the storage resources allocation, centralize and insecure the network against malicious actions/actors.\r\n\r\nAlready discussed previously in this message, so won't repeat. But, even encountering a net reduction of for example 5,000 full nodes out of 100,000+ full nodes does not move the needle.\r\n\r\n> In consequence, as @luke-jr proposed: the autor of this proposal is encouraged to withdraw it and abandon it entirely. The autor of this proposal is free to pursue innovations and ideas in e.g. an OIP-0001 or the likes.\r\n\r\nWithdrawing the proposal would achieve nothing materially positive; it would only maybe negatively affect the situation, since it could make it harder to improve the proposal, and maybe make it harder to have a single source of truth re: the proposal.\r\n\r\nAbandoning it would do nothing to change the operation of it, either. This development is an example of Bitcoin's permissionless innovation characteristic: it's already released into the wild, so now the free market has taken over and will decide to what degree Ordinals & Inscriptions gain traction.\r\n\r\nBased on comments by experts of the BIP process (not the people who have used their comments and emojis to indicate disapproval of the BIP itself), including Luke himself, this BIP is legitimate and lacks any good reason not to be accepted.\r\n\r\nI hope my message has helped clarify why, on the aspect of financial incentive for full node runners and possible incentive of Inscriptions to reduce full nodes, the situation is not so clearly negative as may first be imagined.",

Part of this includes doing their part to decentralize the network, which includes running the full node. So, it can be thought of a relatively tiny investment to help support their bitcoin investment, not to mention the various non-direct and non-indirect financial interests in running the full node for their own benefit.\r\n>\r\nA node runner will reach his/her own interest participating in the bitcoin network running a Light-Node (pruned bitcoin node), since this one actor will try to profit from the decentralization achieved by other Full-Node-Runners without spending in a storage device with bigger capacity. Since this actor/role would be not motivated anymore to support the network decentralization based on ideological motives (giving storage resource for free only for financial-transactional-bits) would act probably only pursuing his/her own economical/financial interests. Also every actor in the bitcoin network is free to quit or liquidate completely his/her saving/investments at anytime permissionless.\r\n\r\n> > If such kind of rational actors do not agree to provide storage for non-financial-transaction-bits (since once the e.g. 1 TB SSD is full, these actors will not buy a SSD of bigger capacity and provide this resource to the bitcoin network) then, they will change to run a Light-Node (to participate sovereignly in the network).\r\n> \r\n>> What is the reason not to upgrade the 1 TB SSD, once full? Storage cost is one of which falls in price the fastest. The storage can only increase max about 210 GB per year, no further, and we are at about 550 GB, so that means at least 2 years more. By then, prices will likely have fallen even further (in 2 years, price for an example 2 TB SSD has fallen 63% from about $440 to $160 -- https://3cmls.co/US/B08RK2SR23, so might be $60 in another 2 years, which would be 25% cheaper than the average price of 1 TB SSD now).\r\n>> \r\nAs exposed above. His/her ideological motives; which is a fact to consider among the bitcoin network participants.\r\n>\r\n> And anyway, segwit already locked in the max of about 210 GB storage increase per year, and segwit had consensus, so this should be expected and supported and assumed by a runner of a full node, irrespective of the form the txs take ('normal' txs or arbitrary data txs).\r\n> \r\n> Plus, arbitrary data txs have already occurred throughout Bitcoin's history via p2ms, before Inscriptions-based arbitrary data ever became a thing, so this is not actually a new phenomenon. Full node runners have always hosted arbitrary data.\r\n> \r\nThe SegWit in addition with Taproot created a freedom degree in the protocol to include less restrictive non-financial-transaction-bits, which is now been exploited by the Ordinal/Inscription implementation. This changed the characteristics and properties for the blockchain (Timechain) usage without consensus, but de facto. This consensus missing is clearly evidenced in the discussion and divisions expressed among bitcoin network participants on the different social media platforms and protocols (including this formal and official plenum for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals).\r\n\r\n> > This rational action could have the total effect to reduce the decentralization and security of the bitcoin network.\r\n> \r\n> Sure, everyone makes their own decisions, so full node runners must choose too. On the other hand, there have been reports from many that demand to run full nodes has jumped dramatically (one report indicated more demand to run full nodes in a matter of weeks/months recently than in prior 5 years total), so while there may be some loss due to ideological reasons, there may also be some gain due to new users entering Bitcoin. We will have to wait to see the full net effect on full nodes.\r\n> \r\n> > It would be in interest of all the bitcoin network’s stakeholders to take decisions/actions in consensus\r\n> \r\n> Ordinals and Inscriptions do not require consensus to operate. They are not forks of any kind.\r\n> \r\nWhich at the same time, following this argument, implies the not necessity for creating a BIP number or in its defect an informative BIP for the bitcoin community. Ordinals and Inscription did not follow the social consensus workflow, but put in the wild de facto through exploiting a freedom degree created from previous formal consensus.\r\n\r\n> Ordinals are simply an arbitrary way of thinking about sats that categories sats into different levels of \"rarity\", like with the numismatic value of fiat coins. Meanwhile, Inscriptions are technically-valid Bitcoin txs that allow arbitrary data storage. Both are enabled via a custom wallet that lets one distinguish and work with sats, functionality that is required by both.\r\n> \r\n> > and strengthen the incentives of Full-Node-Runners to provide storage resource.\r\n> \r\n> Already discussed previously in this message, so won't repeat.\r\n> \r\n> > Focusing only on the economical/financial incentives of miner-actors ceteris paribus\r\n> \r\n> Just to be clear, the miners are critical elements of the network, in terms of the security they provide. The full nodes' contribution to security is not even in the same realm as that provided by miners. It has always been known that the miners' compensation, via subsidy, is exponentially falling every 4 years, and so it requires to be compensated for by fees (generated by txs on the base layer). This means blocks should be full to generate fee pressure and a fee market, so that high-enough-fee rate txs (economically competitive txs) become the norm on the base layer. It is very very very important to focus on incentives of miners; it is IMO the most important element of the Bitcoin network, since without security everything falls apart.\r\n> \r\nThe bitcoin network (including some miner-actors) was able to survive in the free market for quite more than 14 years. Exponentially falling subsidy every 4 years was clear exposed at the very beginning of bitcoin network design and operation in the wild. This fee pressure and market competition should be assumed by every miner-actor and do not require any intervention from the bitcoin community to provide any miner support via non-financial-transactional-fee compensation.\r\nIf the bitcoin network can not survive with its original design and operation without intervention tried to be achieved via Ordinal/Inscription implementation, then its existence will be wiped out by the free market; which is our common ideology or efficient economical way of thinking.\r\n\r\n> > would destabilize the storage resources allocation, centralize and insecure the network against malicious actions/actors.\r\n> \r\n> Already discussed previously in this message, so won't repeat. But, even encountering a net reduction of for example 5,000 full nodes out of 100,000+ full nodes does not move the needle.\r\n> \r\n> > In consequence, as @luke-jr proposed: the autor of this proposal is encouraged to withdraw it and abandon it entirely. The autor of this proposal is free to pursue innovations and ideas in e.g. an OIP-0001 or the likes.\r\n> \r\n> Withdrawing the proposal would achieve nothing materially positive; it would only maybe negatively affect the situation, since it could make it harder to improve the proposal, and maybe make it harder to have a single source of truth re: the proposal.\r\n> \r\nSince Ordinal/Inscription is not a bitcoin community proposal there is not evidence at all its withdrawal could have any negative effects for Bitcoin.\r\n\r\n> Abandoning it would do nothing to change the operation of it, either. This development is an example of Bitcoin's permissionless innovation characteristic: it's already released into the wild, so now the free market has taken over and will decide to what degree Ordinals & Inscriptions gain traction.\r\n> \r\n> Based on comments by experts of the BIP process (not the people who have used their comments and emojis to indicate disapproval of the BIP itself), including Luke himself, this BIP is legitimate and lacks any good reason not to be accepted.\r\n> \r\nA reason to not accept this proposal is not in keeping with the Bitcoin philosophy; in which a social consensus ex-ante shall be reached.\r\n\r\n> I hope my message has helped clarify why, on the aspect of financial incentive for full node runners and possible incentive of Inscriptions to reduce full nodes, the situation is not so clearly negative as may first be imagined.\r\n\r\nA hope also, a help could be provided to a deeper understanding of this situation.",

      "body": "> But this is not about what people do with the Bitcoin protocol or Bitcoin Wallets, but with what people do with the ordinals NFT protocol and monkeypics wallets. Whether or not that scheme uses Bitcoin is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, this BIP describes ordinals and not inscriptions. Ordinals are essentially like augmented reality glasses for Bitcoin that enable tracking of sats. This technology alone doesn't seem to have any direct connection to NFTs or jpegs. As for the so-called \"inscriptions\", those could be classified as spam, but this BIP does not touch on this topic.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the backlash this PR received was unwarranted. Those who do not find the idea of these AR glasses appealing can simply not put them on (which is the default setting anyway). The real question at hand is whether or not a BIP that provides a means for individuals to augment their interpretation of the chain is allowed. Personally, I believe we shouldn't block this, and therefore support merging this.",

          "title": "Add option to inscribe BitTorrent (V1) infohashes",
          "body": "This adds a new `--torrent` CLI flag (plus some related `--torrent-xxx` options) to `ord wallet inscribe`, which automatically creates a torrent for the given file (by default, in the same directory with a `.torrent` extension) and inscribes its SHA-128 infohash alongside the file's (regular) SHA-256 using the `sha2,btih` content type.\r\n\r\nThe explorer was also adapted to render torrent inscriptions with the infohash/sha256 hex and a magnet link.\r\n\r\nWith this, files can be stored off-chain on the BitTorrent P2P network while the Bitcoin blockchain is used to commit to the file and to provide its `infohash`, which acts as a locator for obtaining the file from BitTorrent (using DHT or trackers).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhy not IPFS?\r\n\r\nI haven't really found a compelling reason to prefer IPFS. It can work better for files that are duplicated across multiple torrents but it should rarely be the case here. Also bittorrent has a more mature ecosystem, better tooling, and more people already have a client installed.\r\n\r\nWhy not BitTorrent V2?\r\n\r\nI couldn't find a Rust library that supports it. Also it appears that many bittorrent clients don't support V2 yet, including [webtorrent](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent) (which is pretty neat and worth supporting imo).\r\n\r\nWhy inscribe the SHA-256 too?\r\n\r\nMainly to have an easy way for users to verify the file if they get it through some other non-torrent means (and therefore don't have the torrent metadata, which is necessary to confirm the infohash matches the file -- edit: [not quite true](https://github.com/casey/ord/pull/1805#issuecomment-1439371596)) and to avoid relying solely on the SHA-128 used by BitTorrent V1. This also enables the Nostr storage mentioned below.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt's possible to improve file availability and download speeds by providing some centrally managed services:\r\n\r\n- A tracker. Having a tracker specifically for ordinal/inscription users could help improve peer discovery. The tracker could be set to only accept infohashes that were inscribed on the blockchain, so that it couldn't be used as a free-for-all tracker (with [webtorrent/bittorrent-tracker](https://github.com/webtorrent/bittorrent-tracker), the `filter` callback can be used to check with an external database/api).\r\n\r\n- A DHT bootstrap node. Having ordinal users connect to it can similarly help improve connectivity. (some possible options are [bittorrent/bootstrap-dht](https://github.com/bittorrent/bootstrap-dht) and [webtorrent/bittorrent-dht](https://github.com/webtorrent/bittorrent-dht))\r\n\r\n- A WebSeed mirror. [BEP 19](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0019.html) defines a standard for adding HTTP mirrors to torrents, which can be used in addition to normal peers or as a fallback if there are none.\r\n\r\n  The ordinals.com server (or whoever else is interested in providing a mirror) would need to run a daemon that: (1) Listens for infohash inscriptions, (2) Downloads the torrents associated with them (probably with some size limit), and (3) Makes them available for download over HTTP.\r\n\r\n  It appears that [webtorrent](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent) can be used to achieve this quite easily. It even includes a [built-in http server](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent/blob/master/docs/api.md#clientcreateserveropts-force) that could be used as the webseed server [0].\r\n\r\nThis PR assumes that such services exists (on `tracker.ordinals.com`/`dht.ordinals.com`/`webseed.ordinals.com`), and embeds them into the generated `.torrent` files and magnet links. If you'd like me to, I can remove this.\r\n\r\n[0] I submitted https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent/pull/2487 to add support for serving the `.torrent` file, which this PR assumes to be available on the webseed server at `<WEBSEED_URL>/<INFOHASH>.torrent`. This makes magnet links work even when there are no p2p seeds.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUsing Nostr for storage\r\n\r\nThis can be achieved with this PR by inscribing an `event.json` file with the Nostr event in the [JSON serialization format](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md#events-and-signatures) used for event IDs. For example:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\necho -n '[0,\"mypubkey\",1676880792,1,[],\"hello nostr!\"]' > event.json\r\nord wallet inscribe --torrent event.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will inscribe the Nostr event ID as the committed SHA-256, which can then be looked up on Nostr relays. The inscribed torrent can be used as a backup, or ignored.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPossible future work:\r\n\r\n- Display file previews directly in the browser, either via a webseed http mirror [1] or using an in-browser webtorrent client (its pretty neat that the torrent can be downloaded right in the browser! -- although with the caveat that it can only connect to other [WebRTC-enabled](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent/issues/369) peers. See [instant.io](https://instant.io) for a cool demonstration of it.)\r\n\r\n- Because the inscriptions here are pretty small, this could theoretically use `OP_RETURN`, which would avoid the complexities of the two commit/reveal transactions.\r\n\r\n[1] I submitted https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent/pull/2488 to make embedding files from the webseed slightly easier.\r\n",

We cannot simply assign a number to every Informational BIP that meets all the technical requirements but is antithetical to what Bitcoin stands for philosophically. The BIP list would end up looking absurd and devolve into an EIP list.\r\n\r\nUntil Bitcoin's philosophy is clearly and unambiguously addressed in BIP 2, merging this PR would set the wrong precedent by tacitly acknowledging that this PR is in keeping with Bitcoin's philosophy, which, judging by the obvious schism, is highly debatable if not outright dubious.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, there is simply no way to equitably merge this PR without first defining Bitcoin’s philosophy in BIP 2. The charitable thing to do here would be to close this PR. The author is free to open a new PR after BIP 2 has been updated.",

In many ways it provides countless opportunities to educate users about why the final paragraph of section 10 is so important, by demonstrating in a very direct way how simple it is to subvert the anonymity of users who do not practice good hygiene in regards to key/coin control.\r\n\r\nAdditionally a BIP MUST:\r\n\"be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement\" - This proposal includes all relevant material needed to implement a client that would be fully compatible with the reference implementation.\r\n\"must represent a net improvement\" - This directly enables users to create/use stable identifiers with no direct tangible case for negatives that outweigh it. \r\n\"must be solid and must not complicate the protocol unduly\" - Reference implementation has no mandatory implementation in Bitcoin protocol and therefore cannot complicate it.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the complaint that it needs to be implemented on independent software(s) is factually false as that criteria applies specifically when checking for \"de facto adoption\" and \"[is] not to be used as reasons to oppose or reject a BIP\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt should be clear at this point, to any unbiased reader, that the refusal to assign a BIP number is not related to this proposal, but is a byproduct of the reference implementation of this proposal also implementing a system that uses SegWit in a way that hurts people's feelings. Having read the discussion the majority of technical/network concerns are concerned with features that are NOT part of this BIP (and make me question if said users actually read the proposed BIP or just Twitter).

This rule is required to handle\n+the two pairs of mainnet transactions with duplicate transaction IDs, namely\n+the coinbase transactions of blocks 91812/91842, and 91722/91880, mined before\n+[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki BIP-34] made\n+the creation of transactions with duplicate IDs impossible.\n+\n+For the purposes of the assignment algorithm, the coinbase transaction is\n+considered to have an implicit input equal in size to the subsidy, followed by\n+an input for every fee-paying transaction in the block, in the order that those\n+transactions appear in the block. The implicit subsidy input carries the\n+block's newly created sats. The implicit fee inputs carry the sats that were\n+paid as fees in the block's transactions.\n+\n+Underpaying the subsidy does not change the ordinal numbers of sats mined\n+in subsequent blocks. Ordinals depend only on how many sats could have been\n+mined, not how many actually were.\n+\n+=== Specification ===\n+\n+Sats are numbered and transferred with the following algorithm:\n+\n+```python\n+# subsidy of block at given height\n+def subsidy(height):\n+  return 50 * 100_000_000 >> height // 210_000\n+\n+# first ordinal of subsidy of block at given height\n+def first_ordinal(height):\n+  start = 0\n+  for height in range(height):\n+    start += subsidy(height)\n+  return start\n+\n+# assign ordinals in given block\n+def assign_ordinals(block):\n+  first = first_ordinal(block.height)\n+  last = first + subsidy(block.height)\n+  coinbase_ordinals = list(range(first, last))\n+\n+  for transaction in block.transactions[1:]:\n+    ordinals = []\n+    for input in transaction.inputs:\n+      ordinals.extend(input.ordinals)\n+\n+    for output in transaction.outputs:\n+      output.ordinals = ordinals[:output.value]\n+      del ordinals[:output.value]\n+\n+    coinbase_ordinals.extend(ordinals)\n+\n+  for output in block.transaction[0].outputs:\n+    output.ordinals = coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+    del coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+</pre>\n+\n+=== Terminology and Notation ===\n+\n+A satpoint may be used to indicate the location of a sat within an output. A\n+satpoint consists of an outpoint, i.e., a transaction ID and output index, with\n+the addition of the offset of the ordinal within that output. For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+`680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6`\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.\n+\n+''Congestion: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+transactions, and drive up fees.''\n+\n+Since Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong\n+positive of the proposal.\n+\n+''UTXO set bloat: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+entries in the UTXO set, and thus increase the size of the UTXO set, which all\n+full nodes are required to track.''\n+\n+The dust limit, which makes outputs with small values difficult to create,\n+should encourage users to create non-dust outputs, and to clean them up once\n+they no longer have use for the sats that they contain.\n+\n+=== Security ===\n+\n+The public key associated with a sat may change. This requires actively\n+following the blockchain to keep up with key changes, and requires care\n+compared to a system where public keys are static. However, a system with\n+static public keys suffers from an inability for keys to be rotated or accounts\n+to change hands.\n+\n+Ordinal-aware software must avoid losing valuable sats by unintentionally\n+relinquishing them in a transaction, either to a non-controlled output or by\n+using them as fees.\n+\n+=== Privacy considerations ===\n+\n+Ordinals are opt-in, and should not impact the privacy of existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals are themselves public, however, this is required by the fact that many\n+of the applications that they are intended to enable require public\n+identifiers.\n+\n+Ordinal aware software should never mix sats which might have some publicly\n+visible data associated with their ordinals with sats intended for use in\n+payments or savings, since this would associate that publicly visible data with\n+the users otherwise pseudonymous wallet outputs.\n+\n+=== Fungibility considerations ===\n+\n+Since any sat can be sent to any address at any time, sat that are transferred,\n+even those with some public history, should be considered to be fungible with\n+other sats with no such history.\n+\n+=== Backward compatibility ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are fully backwards compatible and require no changes to the\n+bitcoin network.\n+\n+=== Drawbacks ===\n+\n+==== Large Index Size ====\n+\n+Indexes supporting fast queries related to ordinals are slow to build and\n+consume large amounts of space.\n+\n+An O(1) index that maps UTXOs to the ordinals that they contain is currently\n+100 GiB. The same index including spent outputs is 10 TiB.",

They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.",

These numbers are termed \"ordinal numbers\", or \"ordinals\", as they are\n+ordinal numbers in the mathematical sense, giving the order of each sat in the\n+total supply. The word \"ordinal\" is nicely unambiguous, as it is not used\n+elsewhere in the Bitcoin protocol.\n+\n+The ordinal numbers of sats in transaction inputs are transferred to output\n+sats in first-in-first-out order, according to the size and order of the\n+transactions inputs and outputs.\n+\n+If a transaction is mined with the same transaction ID as outputs currently in\n+the UTXO set, following the behavior of Bitcoin Core, the new transaction\n+outputs displace the older UTXO set entries, destroying the sats contained in\n+any unspent outputs of the first transaction. This rule is required to handle\n+the two pairs of mainnet transactions with duplicate transaction IDs, namely\n+the coinbase transactions of blocks 91812/91842, and 91722/91880, mined before\n+[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki BIP-34] made\n+the creation of transactions with duplicate IDs impossible.\n+\n+For the purposes of the assignment algorithm, the coinbase transaction is\n+considered to have an implicit input equal in size to the subsidy, followed by\n+an input for every fee-paying transaction in the block, in the order that those\n+transactions appear in the block. The implicit subsidy input carries the\n+block's newly created sats. The implicit fee inputs carry the sats that were\n+paid as fees in the block's transactions.\n+\n+Underpaying the subsidy does not change the ordinal numbers of sats mined\n+in subsequent blocks. Ordinals depend only on how many sats could have been\n+mined, not how many actually were.\n+\n+=== Specification ===\n+\n+Sats are numbered and transferred with the following algorithm:\n+\n+<source lang=\"python\">\n+# subsidy of block at given height\n+def subsidy(height):\n+  return 50 * 100_000_000 >> height // 210_000\n+\n+# first ordinal of subsidy of block at given height\n+def first_ordinal(height):\n+  start = 0\n+  for height in range(height):\n+    start += subsidy(height)\n+  return start\n+\n+# assign ordinals in given block\n+def assign_ordinals(block):\n+  first = first_ordinal(block.height)\n+  last = first + subsidy(block.height)\n+  coinbase_ordinals = list(range(first, last))\n+\n+  for transaction in block.transactions[1:]:\n+    ordinals = []\n+    for input in transaction.inputs:\n+      ordinals.extend(input.ordinals)\n+\n+    for output in transaction.outputs:\n+      output.ordinals = ordinals[:output.value]\n+      del ordinals[:output.value]\n+\n+    coinbase_ordinals.extend(ordinals)\n+\n+  for output in block.transaction[0].outputs:\n+    output.ordinals = coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+    del coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+</source>\n+\n+A miner may underpay the block reward, in which case\n+<code>coinbase_ordinals</code> will not be empty when\n+<code>assign_ordinals</code> returns. These sats are lost and not assigned to\n+any output of the coinbase transaction.\n+\n+=== Terminology and Notation ===\n+\n+A satpoint may be used to indicate the location of a sat within an output. A\n+satpoint consists of an outpoint, i.e., a transaction ID and output index, with\n+the addition of the offset of the ordinal within that output. For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+<code>680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6</code>\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.",

A\n+satpoint consists of an outpoint, i.e., a transaction ID and output index, with\n+the addition of the offset of the ordinal within that output. For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+<code>680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6</code>\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.\n+\n+''Congestion: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+transactions, and drive up fees.''\n+\n+Since Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong\n+positive of the proposal.\n+\n+''UTXO set bloat: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+entries in the UTXO set, and thus increase the size of the UTXO set, which all\n+full nodes are required to track.''\n+\n+The dust limit, which makes outputs with small values difficult to create,\n+should encourage users to create non-dust outputs, and to clean them up once\n+they no longer have use for the sats that they contain.",

A\n+satpoint consists of an outpoint, i.e., a transaction ID and output index, with\n+the addition of the offset of the ordinal within that output. For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+<code>680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6</code>\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.\n+\n+''Congestion: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+transactions, and drive up fees.''\n+\n+Since Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong\n+positive of the proposal.\n+\n+''UTXO set bloat: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+entries in the UTXO set, and thus increase the size of the UTXO set, which all\n+full nodes are required to track.''\n+\n+The dust limit, which makes outputs with small values difficult to create,\n+should encourage users to create non-dust outputs, and to clean them up once\n+they no longer have use for the sats that they contain.\n+\n+=== Security ===\n+\n+The public key associated with a sat may change. This requires actively\n+following the blockchain to keep up with key changes, and requires care\n+compared to a system where public keys are static. However, a system with\n+static public keys suffers from an inability for keys to be rotated or accounts\n+to change hands.\n+\n+Ordinal-aware software must avoid losing valuable sats by unintentionally\n+relinquishing them in a transaction, either to a non-controlled output or by\n+using them as fees.",

The implicit subsidy input carries the\n+block's newly created sats.

Ordinals depend only on how many sats could have been\n+mined, not how many actually were.\n+\n+=== Specification ===\n+\n+Sats are numbered and transferred with the following algorithm:\n+\n+<source lang=\"python\">\n+# subsidy of block at given height\n+def subsidy(height):\n+  return 50 * 100_000_000 >> height // 210_000\n+\n+# first ordinal of subsidy of block at given height\n+def first_ordinal(height):\n+  start = 0\n+  for height in range(height):\n+    start += subsidy(height)\n+  return start\n+\n+# assign ordinals in given block\n+def assign_ordinals(block):\n+  first = first_ordinal(block.height)\n+  last = first + subsidy(block.height)\n+  coinbase_ordinals = list(range(first, last))\n+\n+  for transaction in block.transactions[1:]:\n+    ordinals = []\n+    for input in transaction.inputs:\n+      ordinals.extend(input.ordinals)\n+\n+    for output in transaction.outputs:\n+      output.ordinals = ordinals[:output.value]\n+      del ordinals[:output.value]\n+\n+    coinbase_ordinals.extend(ordinals)\n+\n+  for output in block.transaction[0].outputs:\n+    output.ordinals = coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+    del coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+</source>\n+\n+A miner may underpay the block reward, in which case\n+<code>coinbase_ordinals</code> will not be empty when\n+<code>assign_ordinals</code> returns. These sats are lost and not assigned to\n+any output of the coinbase transaction.\n+\n+=== Terminology and Notation ===\n+\n+A satpoint may be used to indicate the location of a sat within an output. A\n+satpoint consists of an outpoint, i.e., a transaction ID and output index, with\n+the addition of the offset of the ordinal within that output. For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+<code>680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6</code>\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.\n+\n+''Congestion: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+transactions, and drive up fees.''\n+\n+Since Bitcoin requires the development of a robust fee market, this is a strong\n+positive of the proposal.\n+\n+''UTXO set bloat: Adoption of ordinal numbers will increase the demand for\n+entries in the UTXO set, and thus increase the size of the UTXO set, which all\n+full nodes are required to track.''\n+\n+The dust limit, which makes outputs with small values difficult to create,\n+should encourage users to create non-dust outputs, and to clean them up once\n+they no longer have use for the sats that they contain.\n+\n+=== Security ===\n+\n+The public key associated with a sat may change. This requires actively\n+following the blockchain to keep up with key changes, and requires care\n+compared to a system where public keys are static. However, a system with\n+static public keys suffers from an inability for keys to be rotated or accounts\n+to change hands.\n+\n+Ordinal-aware software must avoid losing valuable sats by unintentionally\n+relinquishing them in a transaction, either to a non-controlled output or by\n+using them as fees.\n+\n+=== Privacy considerations ===\n+\n+Ordinals are opt-in, and should not impact the privacy of existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals are themselves public, however, this is required by the fact that many\n+of the applications that they are intended to enable require public\n+identifiers.\n+\n+Ordinal aware software should never mix sats which might have some publicly\n+visible data associated with their ordinals with sats intended for use in\n+payments or savings, since this would associate that publicly visible data with",

Addresses are\n+single-use, and wallet accounts are private. Additionally, the use of addresses\n+or public keys as stable identifiers precludes transfer of ownership or key\n+rotation.\n+\n+This proposal is motivated by the desire to provide stable identifiers that may\n+be used by Bitcoin applications.\n+\n+== Description ==\n+\n+=== Design ===\n+\n+Every sat is serially numbered, starting at 0, in the order in which it is\n+mined. These numbers are termed \"ordinal numbers\", or \"ordinals\", as they are\n+ordinal numbers in the mathematical sense, giving the order of each sat in the\n+total supply. The word \"ordinal\" is nicely unambiguous, as it is not used\n+elsewhere in the Bitcoin protocol.\n+\n+The ordinal numbers of sats in transaction inputs are transferred to output\n+sats in first-in-first-out order, according to the size and order of the\n+transactions inputs and outputs.\n+\n+If a transaction is mined with the same transaction ID as outputs currently in\n+the UTXO set, following the behavior of Bitcoin Core, the new transaction\n+outputs displace the older UTXO set entries, destroying the sats contained in\n+any unspent outputs of the first transaction. This rule is required to handle\n+the two pairs of mainnet transactions with duplicate transaction IDs, namely\n+the coinbase transactions of blocks 91812/91842, and 91722/91880, mined before\n+[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki BIP-34] made\n+the creation of transactions with duplicate IDs impossible.\n+\n+For the purposes of the assignment algorithm, the coinbase transaction is\n+considered to have an implicit input equal in size to the subsidy, followed by\n+an input for every fee-paying transaction in the block, in the order that those\n+transactions appear in the block. The implicit subsidy input carries the\n+block's newly created sats. The implicit fee inputs carry the sats that were\n+paid as fees in the block's transactions.\n+\n+Underpaying the subsidy does not change the ordinal numbers of sats mined\n+in subsequent blocks. Ordinals depend only on how many sats could have been\n+mined, not how many actually were.\n+\n+=== Specification ===\n+\n+Sats are numbered and transferred with the following algorithm:\n+\n+<source lang=\"python\">\n+# subsidy of block at given height\n+def subsidy(height):\n+  return 50 * 100_000_000 >> height // 210_000\n+\n+# first ordinal of subsidy of block at given height\n+def first_ordinal(height):\n+  start = 0\n+  for height in range(height):\n+    start += subsidy(height)\n+  return start\n+\n+# assign ordinals in given block\n+def assign_ordinals(block):\n+  first = first_ordinal(block.height)\n+  last = first + subsidy(block.height)\n+  coinbase_ordinals = list(range(first, last))\n+\n+  for transaction in block.transactions[1:]:\n+    ordinals = []\n+    for input in transaction.inputs:\n+      ordinals.extend(input.ordinals)\n+\n+    for output in transaction.outputs:\n+      output.ordinals = ordinals[:output.value]\n+      del ordinals[:output.value]\n+\n+    coinbase_ordinals.extend(ordinals)\n+\n+  for output in block.transaction[0].outputs:\n+    output.ordinals = coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+    del coinbase_ordinals[:output.value]\n+</source>\n+\n+A miner may underpay the block reward, in which case\n+<code>coinbase_ordinals</code> will not be empty when\n+<code>assign_ordinals</code> returns. These sats are lost and not assigned to\n+any output of the coinbase transaction.\n+\n+=== Terminology and Notation ===\n+\n+A satpoint may be used to indicate the location of a sat within an output. A\n+satpoint consists of an outpoint, i.e., a transaction ID and output index, with\n+the addition of the offset of the ordinal within that output. For example, if\n+the sat in question is at offset 6 in the first output of a transaction, its\n+satpoint is:\n+\n+<code>680df1e4d43016571e504b0b142ee43c5c0b83398a97bdcfd94ea6f287322d22:0:6</code>\n+\n+== Discussion ==\n+\n+=== Rationale ===\n+\n+Ordinal numbers are designed to be orthogonal to other aspects of the Bitcoin\n+protocol, and can thus be used in conjunction with other layer one and layer\n+applications, even ones that were not designed with ordinal numbers in mind.\n+\n+Ordinal sats can be secured using current and future script types. They can be\n+held by single-signature wallets, multi-signature wallets, time-locked, and\n+height-locked in all the usual ways.\n+\n+By assigning ordinal numbers to all sats without the need for an explicit\n+creation step, the anonymity set of ordinal number users is maximized.\n+\n+Since a sat has an output that contains it, and an output has a public key that\n+controls it, the owner of a sat can respond to challenges by signing messages\n+using the address associated with the controlling UTXO. Additionally, a sat can\n+change hands, or its private key can be rotated without a change of ownership,\n+by transferring it to a new output.\n+\n+Ordinals require no changes to blocks, transactions, or network protocols, and\n+can thus be immediately adopted, or ignored, without impacting existing users.\n+\n+Ordinals do not have an explicit on-chain footprint. However, a valid objection\n+is that adoption of ordinals will increase demand for outputs, and thus\n+increase the size of the UTXO set that full nodes must track. See the\n+objections section below.\n+\n+The ordinal number scheme is extremely simple. The specification above is 15\n+lines of code.\n+\n+Ordinals are fairly assigned. They are not premined, and are assigned\n+proportionally to existing bitcoin holders.\n+\n+Ordinals are as granular as possible, as bitcoin is not capable of tracking\n+ownership of sub-sat values.\n+\n+=== Transfer and the Dust Limit ===\n+\n+Any single-sat transfer can be accomplished in a single transaction, but the\n+resulting transaction may contain outputs below the dust limit, and thus be\n+non-standard and difficult to get included in a block. Consider a scenario\n+where Alice owns an output containing the range of sats [0,10], the current\n+dust limit is 5 sats, and Alice wishes to send send sat 4 and 6 to Bob, but\n+retain ordinal 5. Alice could construct a transaction with three outputs of\n+size 5, 1, and 5, containing sats [0,4], 5, and [6,10], respectively. The\n+second output is under the dust limit, and so such a transaction would be\n+non-standard.\n+\n+This transfer, and indeed any transfer, can be accomplished by breaking the\n+transfer into multiple transactions, with each transaction performing one or\n+more splits and merging in padding outputs as needed.\n+\n+To wit, Alice could perform the desired transfer in two transactions. The first\n+transaction would send sats [0,4] to Bob, and return as change sat [5,10] to\n+Alice. The second transaction would take as inputs an output of at least 4\n+sats, the change input, and an additional input of at least one sat; and create\n+an output of size 5 to Bob's address, and the remainder as a change output.\n+Both transactions avoid creating any non-standard outputs, but still accomplish\n+the same desired transfer of sats.\n+\n+=== Objections ===\n+\n+''Privacy: Ordinal numbers are public and thus reduce user privacy.''\n+\n+The applications using ordinal numbers required them to be public, and reduce\n+the privacy of only those users that decide to use them.\n+\n+''Fungibility: Ordinal numbers reduce the fungibility of Bitcoin, as ordinals\n+received in a transaction may carry with them some public history.''\n+\n+As anyone can send anyone else any sats, any reasonable person will assume that\n+a new owner of a particular sat cannot be understood to be the old owner, or\n+have any particular relationship with the old owner.",
