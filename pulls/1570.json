    "body": "As the BIP process restarts, one general risk in the BIPs is that they become (even more of) a dumping ground for half-baked ideas which even the BIP champion does not work on after the BIP is assigned. While simply never merging new BIPs addresses this issue, this isn't particularly sustainable, and we should instead have some concrete criteria here.\r\n\r\nBIPs generally fall into a few categories with respect to when they should be considered ready for merge:\r\n * they're not particularly controversial (and not about consensus) and move forward towards adoption in several ecosystem projects relatively quickly or,\r\n * they generate lots of discussion, lots of feedback, the champion actively pushes the BIP forward and makes sustained arguments for adoption over some extended time period (this generally applies to consensus changes).\r\n\r\nAs long as the BIP champion is relatively actively pushing for adoption (i.e. active on the BIP outside of the BIP text itself) and actively addressing feedback on the BIP, the BIP should be merged, however if the BIP hasn't seen any adoption anywhere (outside of maybe one project the author wrote) and the BIP champion is off doing other things, I'd argue it clearly should simply be closed.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds some trivial but flexible text to that effect, requiring roughly the above criteria for merge.\r\n\r\nI'd humbly suggest that we apply this criteria to new BIP number assignments (or at least BIP merges, even if they get a temporary number pre-merge) while we hash out whether this criteria makes sense.",

      "message": "Require BIPs be \"beyond the ideation phase\" before being merged\n\nAs the BIP process restarts, one general risk in the BIPs is that\nthey become (even more of) a dumping ground for half-baked ideas\nwhich even the BIP champion does not work on after the BIP is\nassigned. While simply never merging new BIPs addresses this issue,\nthis isn't particularly sustainable, and we should instead have\nsome concrete criteria here.\n\nBIPs generally fall into a few categories with respect to when they\nshould be considered ready for merge:\n * they're not particularly controversial (and not about consensus)\n   and move forward towards adoption in several ecosystem projects\n   relatively quickly or,\n * they generate lots of discussion, lots of feedback, the champion\n   actively pushes the BIP forward and makes sustained arguments for\n   adoption over some extended time period (this generally applies\n   to consensus changes).\n\nAs long as the BIP champion is relatively actively pushing for\nadoption (i.e. active on the BIP outside of the BIP text itself)\nand actively addressing feedback on the BIP, the BIP should be\nmerged, however if the BIP hasn't seen any adoption anywhere\n(outside of maybe one project the author wrote) and the BIP\nchampion is off doing other things, I'd argue it clearly should\nsimply be closed.\n\nThis commit adds some trivial but flexible text to that effect,\nrequiring roughly the above criteria for merge.",

The .tex file is added in this commit. If people prefer, I will try to rewrite in the .svg format, but I put some effort into it so please compare the tex version first.\r\n\r\nTodo:\r\n* [ ] Update svg; remove tex stuff.",

So far, implementation was considered a requirement for a BIP to move to _Final_, and the _Draft_ status was used for a BIP that was not yet recommended to be implemented, or more generally still open to major changes. Under BIP2, number assignment had been happening when BIPs got merged, so in _Draft_ status.\r\n\r\nWhile I agree that it’s not useful to have a huge number of BIPs that never get adopted, it already takes significant effort to write up ideas sufficiently comprehensive to meet the \"high quality\" and \"provides sufficient information to implement from the BIP\" criteria.\r\nIf these two sentences were incorporated into our process, it would mean that we would only assign numbers to BIPs that are ready to progress to _Final_. This is a complete overhaul of the prior process and as such I would concur that this amendment rather be taken into account for a successor Process BIP instead of a change to BIP2.\r\nEither way, it seems to me that a number assignment would be useful long before a BIP is ready to progress to _Final_. \r\n\r\nPerhaps when we update our process, we could consider an approach where a BIP can be merged to the repository as a _Draft_ before assigning a number, named _\"BIP-draft-author-topic\"_, and then a number be assigned when a BIP progresses to _Proposed_.",
