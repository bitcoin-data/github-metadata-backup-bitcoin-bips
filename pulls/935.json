    "body": "I would like to add my HD (paper) wallet implementation to BIP{32,39,85}. It is written as a follow up to reading @jimmysong great book - Programming Bitcoin. \r\n\r\nI had some issues trying to figure out what is going on just by looking on some other python implementations so I decided to write my own as a part of learning process. It should be easy to read and has a heavy load of unit tests. I hope it will help some novice bitcoiners to make their learning curve less steep. ",
