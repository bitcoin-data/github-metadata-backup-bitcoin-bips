    "body": "As Bitcoin has grown, the introduction of new address formats describing new forms of payment instructions has become increasingly fraught with compatibility issues. Not only does there exist traditional on-chain addresses, but some recipients wish to receive Lightning (when the sender supports it) or newer formats such as Silent Payments.\r\n\r\nThis has led to increasing use of the BIP 21 query parameters to encode further optional payment instructions.\r\n\r\nLooking forward, as new payment instructions get adopted, it makes much more sense to include them in query parameters rather than replace the existing address field, ensuring compatibility with senders and recipients who may or may not be upgraded to support all the latest payment instructions.\r\n\r\nThis updates BIP 21 to suggest that future address formats do this.\r\n\r\nFurther, it updates BIP 21 to allow an empty bitcoin address in cases where new payment instructions have moved to becoming mandatory. This isn't a backwards-incompatible change any more than switching to a new address format is, so doesn't impact existing BIP 21 implementations in a new way, however provides a nice conclusion to the query-parameter-based upgrade path - once a form of payment instructions has broad adoption, senders can simply drop the existing address field, keeping their existing query parameter encoding, rather than replace the existing address field. It also addresses the question of what to do if a wallet no longer wishes to receive some legacy on-chain address, but has multiple payment instruction formats that they wish to include - deciding which one to place in the address field would be a difficult task.",

      "body": "(Background discussion for context: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/revisiting-bip21/630)\r\n\r\nThanks for starting this! Conceptually, I agree with the updates but I think we can get a bigger win by advising the use of HRPs directly instead of key-value pairs. The benefits of this approach are:\r\n\r\n* Better taproot support: using HRPs directly would allow us to construct backwards compatible taproot URIs of the form `bitcoin:bc1q...?bc1p...=o` / `bitcoin:bc1q...?bc1p...`\r\n* Support for future payment instructions: any new payment protocol that encodes their payment instructions using bech32m can be included directly, e.g. `bitcoin:bc1q...?newprotocol1<bech32m encoded data>=o`\r\n* Existing unified QR codes can be made smaller: following an upgrade period to allow clients to update, we would be able to create URIs `bitcoin:bc1q...?lnbc1...=o` (instead of `?lightning=lnbc1...`) and fully static URIs `bitcoin:sp1q...?lno1...=o`\r\n\r\nFor senders, this simplifies implementing support for new address types in that clients can implement support for a generic BIP21 URI using HRPs as keys. As the client supports new bech32m encoded addresses, they are supported automatically without any additional changes.\r\n\r\nClients would still need to support new payment instructions that instead decided to use a query parameter, but I would expect most (if not all) clients to prefer bech32m encodings now that they get BIP21 support for free.\r\n\r\nI wrote a rough draft here, feel free use / modify as needed if you find it useful: https://github.com/josibake/bips/commit/07339bdb929113a9e7218f55ef1bfa72b3976f8e",

      "body": "@TheBlueMatt \r\n\r\n> my above claim is that there isn't any (more) difference of opinion :)\r\n\r\nI don't see the resolution to the discussion about bare keys vs key/values above, so it seems open to me, but perhaps you and @josibake hashed it out somewhere else (or I'm just misreading).  If it was resolved somewhere else public, I'd appreciate a link, as I was favoring several of Josie's proposals and I'd like to see what persuaded him to accept the full k/v approach.\r\n\r\n> BIPs are author documents - they aren't somehow blessed and implementers can do whatever they want\r\n\r\nBIPs in the _draft_ and _proposed_ stage are author documents for sure, but it doesn't seem clear to me that they should remain author documents once they enter the _final_ state.  If people implement a supposedly final specification and then the specification changes, that may unnecessarily lead to miscommunication.\r\n\r\n@ajtowns dealt with this problem in BINANAs by giving them revision numbers, so e.g. if I want to reference that a particular implementation of `OP_CAT` is based on the original proposal, I can say BIN24-1.0 and be protected against changes that become BIN24-1.1, etc.  We don't conveniently have that facility with BIPs (I'd have to refer to a commitish) and I think we deal with that by having a _final_ state after which significant changes are not expected.\r\n\r\n> I'm okay with just saying \"no changes at all\", but I think your position that we can make some changes (to describe reality) but not others (to provide forward-looking guidance) results in a pretty bad outcome.\r\n\r\nI'm also ok with \"no changes at all\".  That said, I think describing reality, especially if it's made clear that it differs from the original specification, is very advantageous to later implementers and those attempting to understand how their modern software works.  Not providing post-final forward-looking guidance in the updated BIP doesn't mean that we can't provide that guidance elsewhere, such as a new BIP or a link to a wiki page (in BIP125, I included a link to a [wiki page](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_replacement) to help foster collaboration among implementers and provide a source of living documentation).\r\n\r\nI do want to mention that none of the above is a hill I care to die on; it's just my opinion about editing _final_ BIPs.  If nobody else thinks this is a problem, I'm ok with this PR being merged as-is.",

However, I think in the case of _final_ BIPs, that ideal conflicts with the ideal of not giving anyone unnecessarily privileged access to the specification process.  If there is more than one reasonable way to do something, I don't think the author of a long-adopted spec should be able to use that spec to favor their preferred choices.\r\n\r\nWhich ideal is more important, better documentation or less privilege?  I don't know, which is why I'm ok with this PR being merged even if I'd prefer to see it reduced to only describing how current widely adopted behavior differs from the original spec.",

      "body": "> the ideal of not giving anyone unnecessarily privileged access to the specification process\n\nI'll be honest, I'd never considered that an ideal of the BIP process, including the reason for final BIPs. Of course no one should have some kind of priviledged access to changing Bitcoin, but the BIP process hasn't historically been the gate for that.\n\nAdmittedly I'm not quite sure what ideal/goal we seek to meet with having a \"final\" state - I'd always considered it to exist because we don't have a concept of an \"accepted\" BIP (because the BIP process isn't for \"accepting\" ideas), but we still need some way to mark something as different from \"draft\"/proposed. In that context, the \"final\" concept only really makes any sense for consensus change BIPs. You could argue that a BIP in sufficient adoption is \"final\" in that future changes don't make sense as they invalidate existing implementations which makes no sense, but that doesn't really answer what to do about forward guidance as is proposed here (presumably it's fine?)",

      "message": "Update BIP XXXX with information about more modern usage of it\n\nAs Bitcoin has grown, the introduction of new address formats\ndescribing new forms of payment instructions has become\nincreasingly fraught with compatibility issues. Not only does there\nexist traditional on-chain addresses, but some recipients wish to\nreceive Lightning (when the sender supports it) or newer formats\nsuch as Silent Payments.\n\nThis has led to increasing use of the BIP 21 query parameters to\nencode further optional payment instructions.\n\nLooking forward, as new payment instructions get adopted, it makes\nmuch more sense to include them in query parameters rather than\nreplace the existing address field, ensuring compatibility with\nsenders and recipients who may or may not be upgraded to support\nall the latest payment instructions.\n\nThis updates BIP XXX to suggest that future address formats do this.\n\nFurther, it updates BIP XXX to allow an empty bitcoin address in\ncases where new payment instructions have moved to becoming\nmandatory. This isn't a backwards-incompatible change any more than\nswitching to a new address format is, so doesn't impact existing\nBIP 21 implementations in a new way, however provides a nice\nconclusion to the query-parameter-based upgrade path - once a form\nof payment instructions has broad adoption, senders can simply drop\nthe existing address field, keeping their existing query parameter\nencoding, rather than replace the existing address field. It also\naddresses the question of what to do if a wallet no longer wishes\nto receive some legacy on-chain address, but has multiple payment\ninstruction formats that they wish to include - deciding which one\nto place in the address field would be a difficult task.",
