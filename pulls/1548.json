It can be viewed as a codec for [wallet policies](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1389). \r\n\r\nToday, there exists a plethora of formats for exchanging descriptors, all with downsides:\r\n\r\n- Raw xpubs are underspecified (missing script type)\r\n- The BlueWallet textual format is inefficient (base58 xpubs) and doesn't support arbitrary descriptors.\r\n- Raw [BIP-380](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0380.mediawiki) descriptors are also inefficient and lack metadata.\r\n- [BCR-2023-010](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-010-output-descriptor.md) are efficient but rely on the more complex (d)CBOR encoding.\r\n- JSON encoded textual descriptors are also inefficient and require a JSON implementation.\r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses them all:\r\n\r\n- Based on PSBT, signing devices need not spend additional code space on a separate codec.\r\n- Efficient encoding of extended keys.\r\n- Metadata (title, birth block) supported.\r\n- Every current or future bip-380 descriptor can be represented.\r\n\r\n> Also, descriptors are a textual format, and encoding text in binary is just not very efficient. There are better ways to do that if you really wanted to.\r\n\r\nWe believe it's hopeless to keep a binary representation of output descriptors up to date with the moving target that is textual bip-380 descriptors ([BCR-2020-010](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-010-output-desc.md) attempted but failed).

      "body": "BIP 174 PSBTs and Extended Keys: PSBTs, specified in BIP 174, are a format for partially signed Bitcoin transactions, enabling offline signing and multi-party approval workflows. These transactions may contain extended keys for deriving input and output addresses. Extended keys allow for hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets, where multiple addresses can be derived from a single master key.\r\n\r\nIntroduction of Output Script Descriptors: The proposal suggests introducing an additional field in PSBTs to represent arbitrary BIP 380 output script descriptors. Output script descriptors, specified in BIP 380, provide a concise way to describe various types of output scripts. This addition would enhance the flexibility and interoperability of PSBTs, allowing for more complex transaction scripts.\r\n\r\nOptional Unsigned Transaction: Traditionally, PSBTs include the unsigned transaction itself. However, this proposal suggests making the unsigned transaction optional. This change would allow for the transfer of output descriptors outside of the signing process, potentially simplifying certain workflows or reducing data redundancy.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Hardware signing devices need knowledge of the full descriptor/wallet policy in order to:\r\n- recognize change addresses\r\n- recognize from which of your different _accounts_ (sometimes called _wallets_) the inputs are spending from.\r\n\r\n(The second could perhaps be considered a strengthening of the traditional guarantees of hardware signers, not sure if it was ever formalized before wallet policies; I think it's essential in practice for anything that is not single-user)\r\n\r\nWhile it's true that PSBTs today have enough info to _sign_, they do not have enough info to _do it securely_ - the descriptor is also needed. Therefore, I agree that it would be a great improvement to be able to pass this info via PSBTs; currently, the Ledger app's signing flow is `sign(PSBT, wallet_policy)`, and quite some work in the app goes into figuring out `change`/`address_index` for each input and change output based on the derivations in the PSBT.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think that's a separate discussion, and it's unclear that recycling PSBTs for a purpose other than representing transactions brings any benefit over than directly designing a space-efficient encoding specifically for descriptors or wallet policies – if the <30% space saving that can be obtained with a re-encoding is deemed important in practice.",

I've updated the proposal so it's no longer a PSBT extension but a separate format merely based on PSBT key-value maps.\r\n\r\nI'd like to add proof-of-registration (PoR), but I'm not sure how it's best done. There's some discussion at https://github.com/wizardsardine/liana/issues/539#issuecomment-1877372827, where @bigspider suggests a HMAC scheme and in a later post @pythcoiner suggest that the format of PoR field should be vendor defined. I'm still of the position that to be maximally useful and interoperable, the PoR field should have a defined format and be a signature, not a HMAC.",

There's some discussion at [wizardsardine/liana#539 (comment)](https://github.com/wizardsardine/liana/issues/539#issuecomment-1877372827), where @bigspider suggests a HMAC scheme and in a later post @pythcoiner suggest that the format of PoR field should be vendor defined. I'm still of the position that to be maximally useful and interoperable, the PoR field should have a defined format and be a signature, not a HMAC.\r\n\r\nAs i already said in previous discussion, i do not have strong opinion about wether the PoR should be standardized or not, but i do not think it should be standardized in this BIP.\r\n\r\nAnd anyway if i get it well both sheme (HMAC vs Signature) will be 32 bytes of data?\r\n",

I've added the mandatory headers, added a compatibility section, and expanded the rationale section.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the main source of contention is whether the format should be separate or part of PSBT. While convenient to extend PSBT, it's probably best to separate the format if for nothing else than descriptors are useful outside signing flows.\r\n\r\nProof of registration can wait for a future extension BIP, as suggested by @pythcoiner.",

Even tho I understand @achow101 comments. \r\n\r\nRegardless of the format here (which i haven't studied) it is useful to have descriptor (or at least policy) in PSBT. Example from Coldcard is when you want to have multiple miniscripts registered on device that have identical keys in miniscript but policy/script is different. Or same keys same policy but order of keys in policy is different. Here you just cannot infer solely from PSBT which wallet to use because keys match for all wallets...\r\n\r\nwhy not just use `PSBT_GLOBAL_PROPRIETARY` key and send descriptor in there?",

However, a descriptor string by itself is not ideal for\n+transferring between wallets: it lacks a machine recognizable header, cannot\n+represent metadata such as name and birth block, and its use of base58 for\n+extended keys is inefficient.\n+\n+BIP 174 gives us a self-describing file format, metadata as well as a compact,\n+binary representation of keys. Assuming most wallets already implements the PSBT\n+format, the implementation overhead of this BIP is expected to be low\n+<ref> '''Why not extend BIP 174?'''\n+The PSBT format is not a general purpose container format, and descriptors\n+are useful outside of signing flows (backup, initializing wallet\n+software).</ref>\n+<ref> '''Why not use the older Blockchain Commons BCR-2020-010 format?'''\n+The format was [[https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-010-output-desc.md#deprecated-superseded-by-version-3-output-descriptors|recently deprecated]],\n+because its use of reserved CBOR tags.</ref>\n+<ref>'''Why not use the new Blockchain Commons BCR-2023-010 format?'''\n+The [[https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2023-010-output-descriptor.md|BCR-2023-010 format]]\n+is roughly equivalent to this proposal, but was designed and released outside of\n+the usual BIP proposal process.\n+\n+In particular, we believe BCR-2023-010 would have faced opposition\n+in the BIP process because it is based on the [[https://cbor.io/spec.html|CBOR encoding]].\n+CBOR is designed for generality and compactness and is therefore significantly\n+more complex than the PSBT encoding. In contrast, the PSBT key-value maps are\n+supported by all wallet software that interact with PSBT files, are easier to\n+review and fit in embedded devices.\n+\n+Release in late 2023, BCR-2023-010 doesn't event have the advantage of widespread\n+support.</ref>.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+The Binary Output Descriptor (BOD) format consists of a fixed header, a\n+key-value map describing the output descriptor and its metadata followed by a\n+map for each key referenced by the descriptor.\n+\n+ <bod> := <magic> <global-map> <key-map>*\n+ <magic> := 0x62 0x6F 0x64 0xFF\n+ <global-map> := <keypair>* 0x00\n+ <key-map> := <keypair>* 0x00\n+\n+The definition for <tt><keypair></tt> follows [[bip-0174.mediawiki#specification|BIP 174]].\n+\n+The defined global types are as follows:\n+\n+{|\n+!
