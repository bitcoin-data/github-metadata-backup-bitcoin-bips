It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. A shepherds may perform the role of an Author for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.",
