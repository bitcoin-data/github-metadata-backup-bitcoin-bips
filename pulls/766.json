    "body": "Proposal for wider v2 address messages.\r\n\r\nLast time this went around (as a github gist) there were some considerations still to be discussed, for lack of a working mailing list I'll post them here:\r\n\r\n## Considerations\r\n\r\n* ''Client MAY store and gossip address formats that they do not know about'': does it ever make sense to gossip addresses outside a certain overlay network? Say, I2P addresses to Tor? I'm not sure. Especially for networks that have no exit nodes as there is no overlap with the globally routed internet at all.\r\n\r\n* Lower precision of <code>time</code> field? seconds precision seems overkill, and can even be harmful, there have been attacks that exploited high precision timestamps for mapping the current network topology.\r\n\r\n  * (gmaxwell) If you care about space time field could be reduced to 16 bits easily.  Turn it into a \"time ago seen\" quantized to 1 hour precision. (IIRC we quantize times to 2hrs regardless).\r\n\r\n* Rolling <code>port</code> into <code>addr</code>, or making the port optional, would make it possible to shave off two bytes for address types that don't have ports (however, all of the currently listed formats have a concept of port.). It could also be an optional data item (see below).\r\n\r\n* (gmaxwell) Optional (per-service) data could be useful for various things:\r\n\r\n  * Node-flavors for striping (signalling which slice of the blocks the node has in selective pruning)\r\n\r\n  * Payload for is alternative ports for other transports (e.g. UDP ports)\r\n\r\n  * If we want optional flags. I guess the best thing would just be a byte to include the count of them, then a byte \"type\" for each one where the type also encodes if the payload is 0/8/16/32 bits. (using the two MSB of the type to encode the length).  And then bound the count of them so that the total is  still reasonably sized.\r\n",

(like [bip130](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0130.mediawiki))\r\n\r\nI wish we had some kind of standard message for this.\r\n\r\nI think for simplicy of implementation we'd want to mandate that this should be sent *after* `version` but *before* any other (non-BIP-signalling) messages, so a connection won't switch to v2 suddenly halfway other things.\r\n\r\nEdit2: This `sendaddrv2` message could also contain wider addresses that doesn't fit in the `version` message. e.g. addrMe, the TorV3 address that we used to connect to the peer. The `version` message would contain a dummy address (localhost) then.",

I think this message, when sent from one peer to another, would signal support for the first peer to _receive_ `addrv2` messages from the other one. So something like `sendaddrv2`? (like [bip130](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0130.mediawiki) [](/bitcoin/bips/blob/HEAD@{2019-07-31T20:16:55Z}/bip-0130.mediawiki))\r\n> \r\n> I wish we had some kind of standard message for this.\r\n> \r\n> I think for simplicy of implementation we'd want to mandate that this should be sent _after_ `version` but _before_ any other (non-BIP-signalling) messages, so a connection won't switch to v2 suddenly halfway other things.\r\n> \r\n> Edit2: This `sendaddrv2` message could also contain wider addresses that doesn't fit in the `version` message. e.g. addrMe, the TorV3 address that we used to connect to the peer. The `version` message would contain a dummy address (localhost) then.\r\n\r\nIt would seems that that addrMe has been deprecated: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8740",

I'm not sure. Especially for networks that have no exit nodes as there is no overlap with the globally routed internet at all.\r\n\r\nI think relaying unknown networks is very important, because the nodes are often multi-homed. So this might be actually useful for somebody who your node thinks is simply ipv4.\r\nAlso, I believe it would be easier for an attacker to attack, if we don't relay these at all.\r\nLastly, depending on the implementation, this specific behavior might leak that you do support Tor, while you look ipv4 to an attacker.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to not. If an attacker wants to spend our bandwidth, might as well flood with ipv4, we don't check if the node is alive before forwarding them.\r\n\r\nStoring is another thing. With the current rate-limiting, the bandwidth we're spending here is pretty low. But addrman size is bounded, so I wouldn't store everything. Maybe, storing a couple exotic things might make sense if you will be switching in future.",

      "body": "Following up on a discussion started in https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/907#issuecomment-611924492\r\n\r\n> Was it decided how to signal support for the new `addrv2` type of messages? 3 options have been discussed:\r\n>\r\n> 1. Bump the protocol version (to `70016`).\r\n>    _pros:_ simple to implement and the info will be available right after the handshake, without changing the handshake itself.\r\n>    _cons:_ the protocol version is not a bitmap, so if an implementation wants to support `addrv2` then it also has to support all features prior to `70016`, see also [#766 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/766#discussion_r305053562)\r\n>\r\n> 2. Use a new network service bit (`NODE_ADDRV2 = (1 << 4)`).\r\n>    _pros:_ same as 1., see also [#766 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/766#discussion_r336657932)\r\n>    _cons:_ hmm?\r\n>\r\n> 3. Use a new message `sendaddrv2` during the handshake.\r\n>   _pros:_ can send wider addresses during handshake that would not otherwise fit in `addrMe`, but `addrMe` is deprecated. See [#766 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/766#issuecomment-524444473)\r\n>   _cons:_ complicates and requires changes to the handshake and requires handling if the new message `sendaddrv2` arrives after the handshake.\r\n\r\nTo overgeneralize, I think that all else being the same I prefer the \"new message\" mechanism over the \"service bit\" mechanism over the \"protocol version\" mechanism. However, the \"service bit\" mechanism is well-suited for making sure that certain specific node configurations can discover useful peers.\r\n\r\nThe support signaling can be broken down into 2 parts:\r\n\r\n#### Something for my node to signal to peers that it **_wants_** `addrv2` messages.\r\n\r\nThis should be indicated with a `sendaddrv2` message, perhaps something like I've implemented here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16748/commits/c0414a6a17ea2cf5812b45dbddf318059cde0b7e#diff-eff7adeaec73a769788bb78858815c91R2099-R2102\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Something for my node to signal to peers that it **_serves_** `addrv2` messages.\r\n\r\nThis should be indicated with a `NODE_ADDRV2` service bit so that both:\r\n\r\n1. Nodes which specify an `-onlynet` with post-addrv2 networks, and\r\n2. Nodes (probably light/custom nodes) which only support addrv2\r\n\r\nCan discover useful peers during DNS bootstrapping\r\n\r\n#### Why not just use the `NODE_ADDRV2` service bit for both signals?\r\n\r\nAs Marco implies [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/766#discussion_r336657932), if we use the same service bit for both signals, leech nodes (which only really **_want_** `addrv2` messages) will be seen as signaling that they **_serve_** `addrv2` messages, which they  won't.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI'd love some feedback on whether the above seem reasonable, and perhaps some feedback on wether or not `-onlynet` makes sense for all the NetworkIDs specified here.",

But I think it said something that both those properties should be negotiated on a per-link (per-connection) basis. In which case both should be done via a new message type.\r\n\r\nIf you think of service bits as a \"static global\" across the whole Bitcoin network, then it makes sense to only use them for things that don't change often and don't change on a per-connection basis. E.g. `NODE_WITNESS` that indicates you can serialize witness data comes to my mind. Non-consensus related stuff like transaction relay or addr relay can be negotiated on a per-connection basis.",

This will fit perfectly into [bitcoin/bips/pull/17194](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/17194). Maybe use a name like `NODE_GOSSIP_ADDRESSES` to avoid confusion that this is `addr` or `addrv2` specific?\r\n> \r\n> Unfortunately, it is not `addr`/`addrv2` agnostic. Think of this scenario: I am a node that is `-onlynet=torv3`, when doing DNS bootstrapping, if we deploy `NODE_GOSSIP_ADDRESSES` and I use the service bits to filter for those, it is likely that I always connect to old nodes who have no idea about addrv2, however, if we deploy `NODE_ADDRV2` and filter for that, the DNS seeds will be able to help connect me to nodes who at least _claim_ to serve `addrv2` messages.\r\n\r\nI meant two service bits:\r\n\r\n* `NODE_ADDRV2` - support for `addrv2`.\r\n  * The node can parse `addrv2` messages, if it receives them.\r\n  * The node can generate `addrv2` messages - if the node relays addresses to his peers and if the given peer has `NODE_ADDRV2` then the address will be relayed as `addrv2` message. If the peer does not have `NODE_ADDRV2` then the address will be relayed encoded in the old `addr` format.\r\n\r\n* `NODE_GOSSIP_ADDRESSES` - the node would relay some of the addresses to some of its peers, as it works now. This is `addr` vs `addrv2` agnostic and would fit perfectly to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17194 - we will not relay addresses to nodes that did not signal `NODE_GOSSIP_ADDRESSES`.\r\n\r\nSo, for example, a multi-homed `ipv4` and `i2p` node may seek to connect to `ipv4` nodes that have both capabilities in the hopes to learn more `i2p` addresses from them.\r\n\r\n",

They have\n+various advantages compared to the old hidden services, among which better encryption and privacy\n+<ref>[https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/rend-spec-v3.txt Tor Rendezvous Specification - Version 3]</ref>.\n+These services have 256 bit addresses and thus do not fit in the existing <code>addr</code> message, which encapsulates onion addresses in OnionCat IPv6 addresses.\n+\n+Other transport-layer protocols such as I2P have always used longer\n+addresses. This change would make it possible to gossip such addresses over the\n+P2P network, so that other peers can connect to them.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+<blockquote>\n+The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\",\n+\"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be\n+interpreted as described in RFC 2119<ref>[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119 RFC 2119]</ref>.\n+</blockquote>\n+\n+The <code>addrv2</code> message is defined as a message where <code>pchCommand == \"addrv2\"</code>.\n+It is serialized in the standard encoding for P2P messages.\n+Its format is similar to the current <code>addr</code> message format\n+<ref>[https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#addr Bitcoin Developer Reference: addr message]</ref>, with the difference that the \n+fixed 16-byte IP address is replaced by a network ID and a variable-length address, and the time and services format has been changed to VARINT.\n+\n+This means that the message contains a serialized <code>std::vector</code> of the following structure:\n+\n+{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: auto; text-align: center; font-size: smaller; table-layout: fixed;\"\n+!Type\n+!Name\n+!Description\n+|-\n+| <code>VARINT</code> (unsigned)\n+| <code>time</code>\n+| Time that this node was last seen as connected to the network.

Clients SHOULD reject messages with more addresses.\n+\n+Field <code>addr</code> has a variable length, with a maximum of 32 bytes (256 bits). Clients SHOULD reject\n+longer addresses.\n+\n+The list of reserved network IDs is as follows:\n+\n+{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: auto; text-align: center; font-size: smaller; table-layout: fixed;\"\n+!Network ID\n+!Enumeration\n+!Address length (bytes)\n+!Description\n+|-\n+| <code>0x01</code>\n+| <code>IPV4</code>\n+| 4\n+| IPv4 address (globally routed internet)\n+|-\n+| <code>0x02</code>\n+| <code>IPV6</code>\n+| 16\n+| IPv6 address (globally routed internet)\n+|-\n+| <code>0x03</code>\n+| <code>TORV2</code>\n+| 10\n+| Tor v2 hidden service address\n+|-\n+| <code>0x04</code>\n+| <code>TORV3</code>\n+| 32\n+| Tor v3 hidden service address\n+|-\n+| <code>0x05</code>\n+| <code>I2P</code>\n+| 32\n+| I2P overlay network address\n+|-\n+| <code>0x06</code>\n+| <code>CJDNS</code>\n+| 16\n+| Cjdns overlay network address\n+|}\n+\n+To allow for future extensibility, clients MUST ignore address types that they do not know about.\n+Client MAY store and gossip address formats that they do not know about. Further network ID numbers MUST be reserved in a new BIP document.\n+\n+Clients SHOULD reject addresses that have a different length than specified in this table for a specific address ID, as these are meaningless.\n+\n+See the appendices for the address encodings to be used for the various networks.\n+\n+==Compatibility==\n+\n+Send <code>addrv2</code> messages only, and exclusively, when the peer has a certain protocol version (or higher):\n+<source lang=\"c++\">\n+//! gossiping using `addrv2` messages starts with this version\n+static const int GOSSIP_ADDRV2_VERSION = 70016;",

Currently we use heuristics such as `NODE_NETWORK` for that, which is fragile and not future proof. For example, pruned nodes may not have any `NODE_NETWORK*` bit set.
