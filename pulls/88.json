This set is\n+how double spending is checked for: to be valid a transaction must identify unspent outputs in this\n+set using an identifier called an \"outpoint\", which is merely the hash of the output's containing\n+transaction plus an index.\n+\n+The ability to query this can sometimes be useful for a lightweight/SPV client which does not have\n+the full UTXO set at hand. For example, it can be useful in applications implementing assurance\n+contracts to do a quick check when a new pledge becomes visible to test whether that pledge was\n+already revoked via a double spend. Although this message is not strictly necessary because e.g.\n+such an app could be implemented by fully downloading and storing the block chain, it is useful for\n+obtaining acceptable performance and resolving various UI cases.\n+\n+Another example of when this data can be useful is for performing floating fee calculations in an\n+SPV wallet. This use case requires some other changes to the Bitcoin protocol however, so we will\n+not dwell on it here.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+Two new messages are defined. The \"getutxos\" message has the following structure:\n+\n+{|class=\"wikitable\"\n+! Field Size !! Description !! Data type !! Comments\n+|-\n+| 1 || check mempool || bool || Whether to apply mempool transactions during the calculation, thus exposing their UTXOs and removing outputs that they spend.\n+|-\n+| ? || outpoints || vector<COutPoint> || The list of outpoints to be queried. Each outpoint is serialized in the same way it is in a tx message.\n+|}\n+\n+The response message \"utxos\" has the following structure:\n+\n+{|class=\"wikitable\"\n+! Field Size !! Description !! Data type !! Comments\n+|-\n+| 4 || chain height || uint32 || The height of the chain at the moment the result was calculated.\n+|-\n+| 32 || chain tip hash || uint256 || Block hash of the top of the chain at the moment the result was calculated.\n+|-\n+| ? || hit bitmap || byte[] || An array of bytes encoding one bit for each outpoint queried. Each bit indicates whether the queried outpoint was found in the UTXO set or not.\n+|-\n+| ? || result utxos || result[] || A list of result objects (defined below), one for each outpoint that is unspent (i.e. has a bit set in the bitmap).\n+|}\n+\n+The result object is defined as:\n+\n+{|class=\"wikitable\"\n+! Field Size !! Description !! Data type !! Comments\n+|-\n+| 4 || tx version || uint32 || The version number of the transaction the UTXO was found in.\n+|-\n+| 4 || height || uint256 || The height of the block containing the defining transaction, or 0x7FFFFFFF if the tx is in the mempool.\n+|-\n+| ? || output || CTxOut || The output itself, serialized in the same way as in a tx message.\n+|}\n+\n+==Backward compatibility==\n+\n+Nodes indicate support by advertising a protocol version above 70003 and by setting a new\n+NODE_GETUTXO flag in their nServices field, which has a value of 2 (1 << 1).",
