    "body": "Clarified codex32 string specifications, including character limits and updated master seed encoding/decoding processes. Updated references to BIP-0173 and adjusted payload character limits.\r\n\r\n**Rationale**\r\n\r\nHelper PR for #2040: prepares the text for general HRP lengths by defining limits based on string length not data part length and deprecating \"ms\" seed lengths that would have required a messy exception there.\r\n\r\n**Key changes (concise)** c286c2c5a7385113d33b3dd8cbda806bd371523f\r\n\r\n- Overall string max length for regular codex32: explicitly limited to 94 chars. Payload: changed from “up to 74” → up to 72 bech32 characters in the regular format. \r\n\r\n\r\n- Long codex32: new length window (97–1024 characters) and payload allowance relaxed (up to 1001 bech32 chars). \r\n\r\n- Clarified that the checksum’s error model considers low HRP+data per the Bech32 model (BIP-0173).\r\n\r\n**My Summary of Changes:**\r\n- Data part character limits loosened to string length limits outside of _Master seed format_ assuming low HRP bits are covered like BIP-0173.\r\n- Deleted the \"decode\" codex32-secret section as this process should be application specific once HRP is generalized.\r\n- Restricts \"ms\" master seed lengths to multiples of 4 bytes to remove the \"ms\" exception when switching between regular and long format. Leaves our desired 128-, 160-, 192-, 224-, 256-bitlengths as well as many unrequested lengths from 288- to 480-bits.  \r\n  - Removing above 256-bits and below 512-bits could simplify or remove a couple sentences but I already have made the changes necessary for keeping the odd 36-60 byte seeds valid.\r\n- New tighter length restrictions in the updated _Master seed format_ section based on the new multiple-of-4-bytes req.\r\n- Gave the full details of how to derive a deterministic identifier for both fresh secret seeds and reshared secret seeds. (two methods)\r\n- Defined in 1 sentence a \"master share set\" as a k shared strings valid set generated with exactly k-1 fresh shares in accordance with that section.  (I needed this to derive a reshare identifier.) \r\n- Moved the CRC pad note for deterministic implementations here where there is less going on.\r\n- Added a couple `<ref>` notes for the less obvious changes. \r\n- Fixed missing `/ref` so _Footnotes_ now appear at the end of _Rationale_ (they're invisible in master)\r\n- Bolded all section references.\r\n\r\n**Backward-compatibility and migration**\r\n- Existing codex32 strings that encode normal payload lengths should remain valid; however:\r\n\r\n  - Implementations that accepted payloads up to 74 characters may need to be adjusted if they strictly enforce the new 72-character payload limit for regular \"ms\" codex32. We may consider validation supporting both limits for a deprecation window while adopting the new canonical encoding behavior.\r\n  - Implementations that rejected Long codex32 data parts below 77 characters may need to be adjusted as the new HRP coverage will allow them (\"ms\" rules reject however).\r\n  - Implementation that rejected regular codex32 strings below 48 characters may need to be adjusted as the 26 payload character limit does not apply to Codex32 generally, only the Master seed format.  (which should be rejecting based on bytes, not characters, unless the string length is invalid for both checksums)\r\n  - Implementations (Like the one linked to in this BIP!!) that assumed the checksum only covered the data (not HRP) should be reviewed and tested; the text now makes checksum coverage explicit to match the bech32 error model. \r\n\r\n**Security / safety considerations**\r\n\r\n- Larger payloads increase the surface for transcription/QR errors; implementations should:\r\n\r\n- Prefer to use the regular codex32 for small seeds when possible and emphasize machine copy (QR, file) rather than manual transcription. We may want a sentence to \"just because you can, does not mean you should.\" which we already said about mere 127 character secrets, now we can do 1001+ (after the \"ms\" requirement is removed).\r\n\r\n**Test Vectors**\r\nI have a working reference implementation that can validate according to this text's spec as well as #2040's plan so I will be able to generate these and add them when there is reviewer agreement about the text changes. After a round or two of reviews I will mark this draft and add them and my passing implementation.\r\n\r\nThe two deterministic encoding SHOULD/MAY both need a vector or two.  As do the now invalidated \"ms\" lengths that are not multiples of 4.\r\n\r\n**Proposed reviewer checklist**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Confirm the textual changes accurately limit/permit the intended set of lengths (regular and long).\r\n\r\n- [ ] Confirm the decoding steps are implementable and are referenced accurately.\r\n\r\n- [ ] TODO: Run unit tests against reference vectors (add vectors for boundary lengths and decode-edge cases). \r\n\r\n- [ ] Assess backward compatibility strategy for wallets and libraries that previously accepted different length limits.  (I doubt anyone used 45 byte seeds but it's worth asking around and waiting a few months before they stop decoding without errors/warnings.)",
