    "body": "#478 added a label to BIP 90 that I disagree with.  While the term \"hard fork\" is sometimes used in the way defined in BIP 123, it also is used by many -- including the BIP 123 author -- to refer to consensus changes that require network-wide coordination in deployment to avoid a chain split[1], which is untrue for BIP 90.\r\n\r\nAs the whole purpose of this BIP is explain the type of consensus change that was made and point out that the network split risk is minimal, I don't accept the label \"hard fork\" as a useful or correct designation, and I think it does a disservice to our collective understanding of consensus changes to try to apply a label like this.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n[1] From https://medium.com/@elombrozo/forks-signaling-and-activation-d60b6abda49a:\r\n\r\n> Since hard forks loosen or eliminate existing rules, blocks which would have been rejected by the old rules are now accepted by nodes using the new rules. Examples include increasing the block reward, increasing the maximum base block size, changing the block header format, or changing the proof of work function. Nodes that do not update their rules will reject these blocks and will continue to follow only chains that enforce the old rules. This means that unless all nodes update, we will get a chain split.\r\n",

      "body": ">There isn't a problem with this BIP. The layer is correct... The only real question is whether we consider these kinda of hardforks as a standard/BIP, or an implementation detail (no BIP).\r\n\r\nI disagree.  I think another real question is whether the BIP editor can modify the header against an author's wishes, as was done here.\r\n\r\nAn additional question is whether BIP 123 is misguided in the first place.  I gave one example above, of commentary from the BIP 123 author about hard forks that suggests the common understanding of a \"hard fork\" is something other than the change introduced by BIP 90.  I found another example in BIP 2, under the description of progressing a BIP to \"Final\" status:\r\n\r\n> A hard-fork BIP requires adoption from the entire Bitcoin economy, particularly including those selling desirable goods and services in exchange for bitcoin payments, as well as Bitcoin holders who wish to spend or would spend their bitcoins (including selling for other currencies) differently in the event of such a hard-fork. Adoption must be expressed by de facto usage of the hard-fork in practice (ie, not merely expressing public support, although that is a good step to establish agreement before adoption of the BIP). This economic adoption cannot be established merely by a super-majority, except by literally forcing the minority to accept the hard-fork (whether this is viable or not is outside the scope of this document).\r\n\r\nBIP 90 is, in my view, \"Final\", yet I don't believe the above paragraph applies to it.  In my view, the point of putting the \"Consensus layer\" designation in the header is to aid in a reader's understanding of the change that was made.  In this case, the term \"hard fork\" seems to be generally used to mean something other than the kind of change that was documented in BIP 90 -- even according to the language in BIP 2.  \r\n\r\nAs to your question of whether these kind of consensus changes are mere implementation details that should not be documented as BIPs: the fact that there is disagreement over whether the change that this BIP describes is a good idea (at least one commenter \"NACK\"ed the change, in discussion on the mailing list) suggests that this is more than an implementation detail, and that documentation and discussion is worthwhile.  And since the changes affect existing, published BIPs, I don't know of a better place to document such changes other than as a BIP itself.\r\n\r\nFurther, I'm not sure why you think that is the \"only real question\" here -- that question doesn't apply to existing BIPs, only new ones.  The subject of this PR is an existing, implemented BIP.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAs for alternatives to BIP 123 -- I think a framework more along the lines of what [Johnson Lau wrote up](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-April/013985.html) could be helpful.  Overall, I think we've learned over the years that the terms \"soft fork\" and \"hard fork\" are not very descriptive to indicate the scope of the sort of changes that can be made, or how safe such a proposed change can be to deploy.\r\n\r\nBut while I'd prefer that we move away from BIP 123, I don't really feel like I should have to sway the whole community to adopt a new framework in order to get the language reverted on a BIP that I have authored.  Changing the document without my approval should not have happened in the first place.  While that may have been an honest mistake, we should not hold up correcting it.",

There is only one rational explanation for this, which is the idea of an objective criteria for definition of the one true Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nAs one who does not find the concept of a \"legitimate\" Bitcoin objective or even interesting, it is easy for me to see that these arguments are bogus and motivated by petty self-interest. Core folks can claim that they have produced only two hardforks, one of which was unintentional and the other has not yet resulted in a chain split.

This change was only a fork if one considers hash collisions possible. Of course hash collisions are possible, but most implementations accept the assumption that they are not. Under this assumption the change became an implementation detail and did therefore not warrant a BIP.\r\n\r\nIf the community similarly accepts the assumption that deep reorgs are not possible, then BIP90 is just an implementation detail, and does not warrant a BIP. However this assumption is clearly **not** generally accepted. For it to be accepted there would need to at least be some agreement on the depth at which reorgs are considered **impossible**. That implies that implementations should **enforce** such a limit, ensuring that it is **actually** impossible.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, and as I have mentioned previously, this attempt to move BIP90 into the ambiguous (and irrational) category of \"fork that's neither hard nor soft\" is being sought as a matter of precedent. There is another pending proposal that attempts to apply the same \"maximum reorg depth\" rationale in other areas. The **only** reason these categorizations matter to people is in the marketing war over what is the \"one true chain\". As the argument goes, if there are no hard forks it's still the true Bitcoin. That argument has already been surrendered by the merge of BIP90.",

      "body": "Please, there is no reason for name calling here.\n\nAs for the \"Bitcoin has never hard forked\" claim, that is blatantly false. Before Bitcoin v0.3.6 (which removed OP_VER), every release was a hard fork. After that, the change to split execution of scriptSig and scriptPubKey in 0.3.7 was a hard fork for certain scripts that include an OP_CODESEPARATOR. The removal of the BDB lock limit in 0.8 is disputable as it wasn't consistent with itself beforehand, but the introduction of a time limited reintroduction of the limit in 0.8.1 certainly was a hard fork compared to 0.8.0.\n\nNone of this matters, in my view. The BIP123 soft fork classification (no risk of a permanent fork conditional on a majority of the hashrate enforcing it) is just one to reduce the risk of consensus changes. Consensus changes are not inherently good or bad. A BIP123 soft fork that froze certain individual's funds would be a complete violation of Bitcoin's principles; a hard fork that fixes a coin stealing bug would be a necessity. Hard forks in this classification are simply far more risky, and to be avoided if possible for that reason.\n\nI think you misunderstand the reasons why people want to see this BIP published without a \"hard fork\" classification. You see it as part of a revisionist plot to maintain a narrative that Bitcoin never hard forked. I believe that narrative is both wrong and irrelevant.\n\nInstead, people want this published as a BIP because the community deserves well-communicated explanations for why a certain implementation believes this change is made, and safe. But the term \"hard fork\", while correct according to BIP123, gives an incorrect understanding. This change will not affect which chain is treated as valid.\n\nIf people insist that BIP90 is classified as a hard fork, I believe the author will just drop the BIP, as it fails to achieve that goal. I believe this would be doing the Bitcoin community a disservice, so I urge to reco sider whether the BIP123 classification is the relevant one.",

We are actually discussing that very important precedent. At what point does a split permanently lock itself in. Nobody has bothered to address that question.

      "body": "@evoskuil I think it's unreasonable to insist that because the security assumptions for a consensus change include no deep reorgs, that we must outlaw such reorgs.\r\n\r\nConsider the following. BIP123 soft forks assume that - in order to avoid a permanent fork - a majority hashrate enforces the new rule. That is an assumption, but we don't (and can't) enforce its correctness. What rules are being enforced by miners is not observable to the network. We approximate it by signalling, but we cannot verify that signalling corresponds to what rules they actually enforce.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, I think BIP90 is analogous in a way: its security assumption is that no deep reorg happens. We need to be upfront about this assumption, but similarly, if the assumption is held, it doesn't require enforcing it. In fact, your suggested way of enforcing it (locking in a block after a certain number of blocks) is not consistent: a new node in the network which only sees the hypothetical newly created branch and only later learns about the original chain will come to a different conclusion. In fact, I believe there is no way to actually enforce a maximum reorg depth that does not in itself introduce extra assumptions.\r\n\r\nMy view is that we should treat security assumptions as assumptions. They need to be stated explicitly, but they are not consensus rules.\r\n\r\nThat is also my suggested answer to this debate: get rid of the hard fork/soft fork designation in BIP headers, but require that all consensus changing BIPs have a section that explicitly state their security assumptions. In many cases, that assumption can be \"As BIP123 soft fork, this change will not result in a permanent fork as long as majority of the hashrate enforces the rule\". In other cases that assumption can be \"Would require an excessively deep reorganization to affect the chain's validity\" or \"Assumes every full node user will upgrade their software by date X\". People can then be free to adopt software that implements such changes based on whether they believe these assumptions are reasonable, but based on clear information.",

      "body": "You misunderstand me. I do not actually propose that we define a max reorg depth. I’m pointing out that by deploying code with such assumptions we are in effect doing so, as if the assumption doesn’t hold we encounter a chain split. I agree with you that it’s not reasonable/consistent, which is why I opposed BIP90 from the outset. And if you re-read above you will see that I in fact proposed what you are now suggesting... extra verbiage that describes the assumption that a chain split is unlikely. There is no reason whatsoever to change the definition of a hard fork to do that, and this is a hard fork (with the security assumption that it is not likely to cause a chain split because...). But if you change the definition of hard fork to include a requirement of a likely chain split you break lots of exiting documentation, including BIP99, BIP123, BIP148 for starters.",

      "body": "@evoskuil I'm not sure what you're referring to. Locking in a fork is not necessarily a hardfork. The most recent softfork - Segwit - is already well locked-in, by both BIP148 and updated checkpoints in at least the past two Bitcoin Knots releases. Consensus checkpoints established the precedent you seem concerned with, a long, long time ago. It is the movement away from checkpoints in Core that is the change - not the existence or continuation of them.",

BIP148 does not “lock in” Segwit, either in the sense we are using the term here (i.e. permanently) or in the sense the term is used in BIP9 (i.e. relative to a branch). BIP148 can have no effect on Segwit if the latter was to be reorganized out (which remains possible though difficult).\r\n\r\n> and updated checkpoints in at least the past two Bitcoin Knots releases. Consensus checkpoints established the precedent you seem concerned with, a long, long time ago. It is the movement away from checkpoints in Core that is the change - not the existence or continuation of them.\r\n\r\nThis statement is oddly contradictory. Checkpoints are bad, that is the point. Moving away from their future use is not a consensus change. The fact that Knots is (apparently) using them to enforce Segwit is just an example of Knots deploying a hard fork against other implementations. Given the presumption that Knots users don’t want to split from more-widely-deployed nodes this is less-than-ideal. If one is operating under the assumption that such a deep reorg is impossible then there is no reason to employ such a hard fork in the first place. The fact of this enforcement implies that one assumes it *is* possible.",

Still, it is not possible to ensure that one is seeing the strongest chain, so even the use of *verified* checkpoints is not a good practice.\r\n\r\nAs you have said many times, and I agree, checkpoints are not a security measure.
