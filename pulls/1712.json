Rose by any other name would smell just as sweet.\r\n\r\n_The only other alternative I could think of would be to make Author a newly optional field, and have a new field (e.g., Proposers) be the sub-in for the current meaning of author. This would also serve to separate authorship and champion-ship cleanly. But that's more confusing and a more major change. So I think Sheperd solves the problem._",

The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol.

However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation.

In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document.

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. A shepherds may perform the role of an Author for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP.

However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations.

The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document.

A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software.

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community.

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. A shepherds may perform the role of an Author for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned.

See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J.

Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders",

See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete.

The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals.

It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/).

However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up to\n+the relevant project directly.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors what issues may arise in its progression. After some investigation,",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted.

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up to\n+the relevant project directly.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors what issues may arise in its progression. After some investigation,\n+the novelty of an idea can be tested by posting about it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). Prior correspondence can be found in the [mailing list\n+archive](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/).\n+\n+Vetting an idea publicly before investing the time to formally describe the idea is meant to save both the authors and",

Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP.

The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects.

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms.

The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code.

A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up to\n+the relevant project directly.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors what issues may arise in its progression. After some investigation,\n+the novelty of an idea can be tested by posting about it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). Prior correspondence can be found in the [mailing list\n+archive](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/).\n+\n+Vetting an idea publicly before investing the time to formally describe the idea is meant to save both the authors and\n+the broader community time. Not only may someone point out relevant discussion topics that were missed in the authorsâ€™\n+research, or that an idea is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions, but describing an idea publicly also\n+tests whether it is of interest to more people besides the authors. After establishing that the idea may be of interest\n+to the bitcoin community, the authors should work on drafting a BIP.\n+\n+As a first sketch of the proposal is taking shape, the authors should present it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). This gives the authors a chance to collect initial feedback and address\n+fundamental concerns. If the authors wish to work in public on the proposal at this stage, it is recommended that they\n+open a pull request against one of their forks of the BIP repository instead of the main BIP repository.\n+\n+It is recommended that complicated proposals be split into separate BIPs that each focus on a specific component of the\n+overall proposal.\n+\n+### Progression through BIP Statuses\n+\n+The following sections refer to BIP Status Field values. The BIP Status Field is defined in the Header Preamble\n+specification above.\n+\n+#### Draft\n+\n+After fleshing out the proposal further and ensuring that it is of high quality and properly formatted, the authors\n+should open a pull request to the [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips). The document must adhere to the\n+formatting requirements specified below and should be provided as a file named with a working title of the form\n+\"bip-title.[md|mediawiki]\". The authors must not self-assign a number to their proposal.\n+\n+BIPs that (1) adhere to the formatting requirements, (2) are on-topic, and (3) have materially progressed beyond the\n+ideation phase, e.g. by generating substantial public discussion and commentary from diverse contributors, by\n+independent bitcoin projects working on adopting the proposal, or by the authors working for an extended period toward\n+improving the proposal based on community feedback, will be assigned a number by a BIP editor. The BIP editors should\n+delay number assignment when they perceive a proposal being met with lack of interest: number assignment facilitates the\n+distributed discussion of ideas, but before a proposal garners some interest in the bitcoin community, there is no need\n+to refer to it by a number.\n+\n+Proposals are also not ready for number assignment if they duplicate efforts, disregard formatting rules, are too\n+unfocused or too broad, fail to provide proper motivation, fail to address backwards compatibility where necessary, or\n+fail to specify the feature clearly and comprehensively. Reviewers and BIP editors should provide guidance on how the\n+proposal may be improved to progress toward readiness. Pull requests that are proposing off-topic or unserious ideas or\n+have stopped to make progress may be closed.\n+\n+When the proposal is ready and has been assigned a number, a BIP editor will merge it into the BIP repository. After the\n+BIP has been merged to the repository, its main focus should no longer shift significantly, even while the authors may\n+continue to update the proposal as necessary. Updates to merged documents by the authors should also be submitted as\n+pull requests.\n+\n+#### Complete[^complete]\n+\n+When the authors have concluded all planned work on their proposal, are confident that their BIP represents a net\n+improvement, is clear, comprehensive, has a working reference implementation and test vectors (if applicable), and is\n+ready for adoption by the bitcoin community, they may update the BIPâ€™s status to Complete to indicate that they\n+recommend adoption, implementation, or deployment of the BIP. Where applicable, the authors must ensure that any\n+proposed specification is solid, not unduly complicated, and definitive. Subsequently, the BIPâ€™s content should only be\n+adjusted in minor details, e.g. to improve language, clarify ambiguities, backfill omissions in the specification, add\n+test vectors for edge cases, or address other issues discovered as the BIP is being adopted.\n+\n+A Complete BIP can only move to Deployed or Closed. Any necessary changes to the specification should be minimal and\n+interfere as little as possible with ongoing adoption. If a Complete BIP is found to need substantial functional\n+changes, it may be preferable to move it to Closed[^new-BIP], and to start a new BIP with the changes instead.\n+Otherwise, it could cause confusion as to what being compliant with the BIP means.\n+\n+Complete is the final state for most successful Informational BIPs.\n+\n+#### Deployed\n+\n+A settled[^settled] BIP may be advanced to Deployed upon request by any community member with evidence that the idea\n+described in the BIP is in active use. Such evidence includes for example: at least one project having deployed support\n+for the BIP in mainnet software releases, a soft fork proposalâ€™s activation criteria having been met on the network, or\n+rough consensus for the BIP having been demonstrated.\n+\n+At that point, the BIP should be considered final and any breaking changes to the BIP should be proposed as a new\n+separate BIP.[^new-BIP]\n+\n+##### Process BIPs\n+\n+A Process BIP may change status from Complete to Deployed when it achieves rough consensus on the mailing list. Such a\n+proposal is said to have rough consensus if it has been open to discussion on the development mailing list for at least\n+one month, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it. Addressed or obstructive objections\n+may be ignored/overruled by general agreement that they have been sufficiently addressed, but clear reasoning must be\n+given in such circumstances. Deployed Process BIPs may be modified indefinitely as long as a proposed modification has\n+rough consensus per the same criteria.[^living-documents]\n+\n+#### Closed[^closed]\n+\n+A BIP that is _not in active use_, may be labeled Closed when its authors have stopped working on it, no longer\n+recommend the proposed approach, or no longer pursue adoption of their Complete proposal. The reason for moving the\n+proposal to Closed should be recorded in the Changelog section in the same commit that updates the status.\n+\n+##### Draft â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIP authors may decide on their own to change their BIPâ€™s status from Draft to Closed. If a Draft BIP stops making\n+progress, sees accumulated feedback unaddressed, or otherwise appears stalled for a year, the community may move the BIP\n+to Closed unless the authors assert that they intend to continue work when contacted.\n+\n+##### Complete â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIPs that had attained the Complete status, i.e. that had been recommended for adoption, may be moved to Closed per the\n+authorsâ€™ announcement to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List after not being opposed within four weeks. To successfully\n+oppose the move, at least one of the opposers must volunteer to become the BIPâ€™s author or shepherd for the BIP to\n+remain Complete. A BIP can also be moved to Closed by the community if it has had Complete status for at least one year,\n+there is no evidence of it being in active use, and its authors do not object or fail to respond, unless a new author\n+volunteers within four weeks.\n+\n+##### Deployed â†¦ Closed\n+\n+A BIP may evolve from Deployed to Closed when it is no longer in active use. Any community member may initiate this\n+Status update by announcing it to the mailing list, and proceed if no objections have been raised for four weeks.\n+\n+##### Closed â†¦ Draft\n+\n+The Closed status is generally intended to be a final status for BIPs.\n+\n+If BIP authors decide to make another attempt at a previously Closed BIP, it is generally recommended to create a new\n+proposal. (Obviously, the authors may borrow any amount of inspiration or actual text from any prior BIPs as licensing\n+permits.) The authors should take special care to address the issues that caused the prior attemptâ€™s abandonment. Even\n+if the prior attempt had been assigned a number, the new BIP will generally be assigned a distinct number, unless it is\n+obvious that the new attempt directly continues work on the same idea, in which case it may be reasonable to return the\n+Closed BIP to Draft status.\n+\n+### Changelog\n+\n+To help implementers understand updates to a BIP, any changes after it has reached Complete are tracked with version,",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>",

The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up to\n+the relevant project directly.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors what issues may arise in its progression. After some investigation,\n+the novelty of an idea can be tested by posting about it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). Prior correspondence can be found in the [mailing list\n+archive](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/).\n+\n+Vetting an idea publicly before investing the time to formally describe the idea is meant to save both the authors and\n+the broader community time. Not only may someone point out relevant discussion topics that were missed in the authorsâ€™\n+research, or that an idea is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions, but describing an idea publicly also\n+tests whether it is of interest to more people besides the authors. After establishing that the idea may be of interest\n+to the bitcoin community, the authors should work on drafting a BIP.\n+\n+As a first sketch of the proposal is taking shape, the authors should present it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). This gives the authors a chance to collect initial feedback and address\n+fundamental concerns. If the authors wish to work in public on the proposal at this stage, it is recommended that they\n+open a pull request against one of their forks of the BIP repository instead of the main BIP repository.\n+\n+It is recommended that complicated proposals be split into separate BIPs that each focus on a specific component of the\n+overall proposal.\n+\n+### Progression through BIP Statuses\n+\n+The following sections refer to BIP Status Field values. The BIP Status Field is defined in the Header Preamble\n+specification above.\n+\n+#### Draft\n+\n+After fleshing out the proposal further and ensuring that it is of high quality and properly formatted, the authors\n+should open a pull request to the [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips). The document must adhere to the\n+formatting requirements specified below and should be provided as a file named with a working title of the form",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required.

The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits.

The BIP Status Field is defined in the Header Preamble\n+specification above.\n+\n+#### Draft\n+\n+After fleshing out the proposal further and ensuring that it is of high quality and properly formatted, the authors\n+should open a pull request to the [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips). The document must adhere to the\n+formatting requirements specified below and should be provided as a file named with a working title of the form\n+\"bip-title.[md|mediawiki]\". The authors must not self-assign a number to their proposal.\n+\n+BIPs that (1) adhere to the formatting requirements, (2) are on-topic, and (3) have materially progressed beyond the\n+ideation phase, e.g. by generating substantial public discussion and commentary from diverse contributors, by\n+independent bitcoin projects working on adopting the proposal, or by the authors working for an extended period toward\n+improving the proposal based on community feedback, will be assigned a number by a BIP editor.

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up to\n+the relevant project directly.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors what issues may arise in its progression. After some investigation,\n+the novelty of an idea can be tested by posting about it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). Prior correspondence can be found in the [mailing list\n+archive](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/).\n+\n+Vetting an idea publicly before investing the time to formally describe the idea is meant to save both the authors and\n+the broader community time. Not only may someone point out relevant discussion topics that were missed in the authorsâ€™\n+research, or that an idea is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions, but describing an idea publicly also\n+tests whether it is of interest to more people besides the authors. After establishing that the idea may be of interest\n+to the bitcoin community, the authors should work on drafting a BIP.\n+\n+As a first sketch of the proposal is taking shape, the authors should present it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). This gives the authors a chance to collect initial feedback and address\n+fundamental concerns. If the authors wish to work in public on the proposal at this stage, it is recommended that they\n+open a pull request against one of their forks of the BIP repository instead of the main BIP repository.\n+\n+It is recommended that complicated proposals be split into separate BIPs that each focus on a specific component of the\n+overall proposal.\n+\n+### Progression through BIP Statuses\n+\n+The following sections refer to BIP Status Field values. The BIP Status Field is defined in the Header Preamble\n+specification above.\n+\n+#### Draft\n+\n+After fleshing out the proposal further and ensuring that it is of high quality and properly formatted, the authors\n+should open a pull request to the [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips). The document must adhere to the\n+formatting requirements specified below and should be provided as a file named with a working title of the form\n+\"bip-title.[md|mediawiki]\". The authors must not self-assign a number to their proposal.\n+\n+BIPs that (1) adhere to the formatting requirements, (2) are on-topic, and (3) have materially progressed beyond the\n+ideation phase, e.g. by generating substantial public discussion and commentary from diverse contributors, by\n+independent bitcoin projects working on adopting the proposal, or by the authors working for an extended period toward\n+improving the proposal based on community feedback, will be assigned a number by a BIP editor. The BIP editors should\n+delay number assignment when they perceive a proposal being met with lack of interest: number assignment facilitates the\n+distributed discussion of ideas, but before a proposal garners some interest in the bitcoin community, there is no need\n+to refer to it by a number.\n+\n+Proposals are also not ready for number assignment if they duplicate efforts, disregard formatting rules, are too\n+unfocused or too broad, fail to provide proper motivation, fail to address backwards compatibility where necessary, or\n+fail to specify the feature clearly and comprehensively. Reviewers and BIP editors should provide guidance on how the\n+proposal may be improved to progress toward readiness. Pull requests that are proposing off-topic or unserious ideas or\n+have stopped to make progress may be closed.\n+\n+When the proposal is ready and has been assigned a number, a BIP editor will merge it into the BIP repository. After the\n+BIP has been merged to the repository, its main focus should no longer shift significantly, even while the authors may\n+continue to update the proposal as necessary. Updates to merged documents by the authors should also be submitted as\n+pull requests.\n+\n+#### Complete[^complete]\n+\n+When the authors have concluded all planned work on their proposal, are confident that their BIP represents a net\n+improvement, is clear, comprehensive, has a working reference implementation and test vectors (if applicable), and is\n+ready for adoption by the bitcoin community, they may update the BIPâ€™s status to Complete to indicate that they\n+recommend adoption, implementation, or deployment of the BIP. Where applicable, the authors must ensure that any\n+proposed specification is solid, not unduly complicated, and definitive. Subsequently, the BIPâ€™s content should only be\n+adjusted in minor details, e.g. to improve language, clarify ambiguities, backfill omissions in the specification, add\n+test vectors for edge cases, or address other issues discovered as the BIP is being adopted.\n+\n+A Complete BIP can only move to Deployed or Closed. Any necessary changes to the specification should be minimal and\n+interfere as little as possible with ongoing adoption. If a Complete BIP is found to need substantial functional\n+changes, it may be preferable to move it to Closed[^new-BIP], and to start a new BIP with the changes instead.\n+Otherwise, it could cause confusion as to what being compliant with the BIP means.\n+\n+Complete is the final state for most successful Informational BIPs.\n+\n+#### Deployed\n+\n+A settled[^settled] BIP may be advanced to Deployed upon request by any community member with evidence that the idea\n+described in the BIP is in active use. Such evidence includes for example: at least one project having deployed support\n+for the BIP in mainnet software releases, a soft fork proposalâ€™s activation criteria having been met on the network, or\n+rough consensus for the BIP having been demonstrated.\n+\n+At that point, the BIP should be considered final and any breaking changes to the BIP should be proposed as a new\n+separate BIP.[^new-BIP]\n+\n+##### Process BIPs\n+\n+A Process BIP may change status from Complete to Deployed when it achieves rough consensus on the mailing list. Such a\n+proposal is said to have rough consensus if it has been open to discussion on the development mailing list for at least\n+one month, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it. Addressed or obstructive objections\n+may be ignored/overruled by general agreement that they have been sufficiently addressed, but clear reasoning must be\n+given in such circumstances. Deployed Process BIPs may be modified indefinitely as long as a proposed modification has\n+rough consensus per the same criteria.[^living-documents]\n+\n+#### Closed[^closed]\n+\n+A BIP that is _not in active use_, may be labeled Closed when its authors have stopped working on it, no longer\n+recommend the proposed approach, or no longer pursue adoption of their Complete proposal. The reason for moving the\n+proposal to Closed should be recorded in the Changelog section in the same commit that updates the status.\n+\n+##### Draft â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIP authors may decide on their own to change their BIPâ€™s status from Draft to Closed. If a Draft BIP stops making\n+progress, sees accumulated feedback unaddressed, or otherwise appears stalled for a year, the community may move the BIP\n+to Closed unless the authors assert that they intend to continue work when contacted.\n+\n+##### Complete â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIPs that had attained the Complete status, i.e. that had been recommended for adoption, may be moved to Closed per the\n+authorsâ€™ announcement to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List after not being opposed within four weeks. To successfully\n+oppose the move, at least one of the opposers must volunteer to become the BIPâ€™s author or shepherd for the BIP to\n+remain Complete. A BIP can also be moved to Closed by the community if it has had Complete status for at least one year,\n+there is no evidence of it being in active use, and its authors do not object or fail to respond, unless a new author\n+volunteers within four weeks.\n+\n+##### Deployed â†¦ Closed\n+\n+A BIP may evolve from Deployed to Closed when it is no longer in active use. Any community member may initiate this\n+Status update by announcing it to the mailing list, and proceed if no objections have been raised for four weeks.\n+\n+##### Closed â†¦ Draft\n+\n+The Closed status is generally intended to be a final status for BIPs.\n+\n+If BIP authors decide to make another attempt at a previously Closed BIP, it is generally recommended to create a new\n+proposal. (Obviously, the authors may borrow any amount of inspiration or actual text from any prior BIPs as licensing\n+permits.) The authors should take special care to address the issues that caused the prior attemptâ€™s abandonment. Even\n+if the prior attempt had been assigned a number, the new BIP will generally be assigned a distinct number, unless it is\n+obvious that the new attempt directly continues work on the same idea, in which case it may be reasonable to return the\n+Closed BIP to Draft status.\n+\n+### Changelog\n+\n+To help implementers understand updates to a BIP, any changes after it has reached Complete are tracked with version,\n+date, and description in a Changelog section. The version number is inspired by semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).\n+The MAJOR version is incremented if changes to the BIPâ€™s Specification are introduced that are incompatible with prior\n+versions (which should be rare after a BIP is Complete, and only happen in well-grounded exceptional cases to a BIP that\n+is Deployed). The MINOR version is incremented whenever the specification of the BIP is changed or extended in a\n+backward-compatible way. The PATCH version is incremented for other changes to the BIP that are noteworthy (bug fixes,\n+test vectors, important clarifications, etc.). The version should start at 1.0.0 with the date the BIP was promoted to\n+Complete. An example of a Changelog section can be seen in\n+[BIPâ€¯352](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0352.mediawiki). After a BIP receives a Changelog, the\n+Preamble must indicate the latest version in the Revision header.\n+\n+### Adoption of proposals\n+\n+The BIP repository does not track the sentiment on proposals and does not track the adoption of BIPs beyond whether they\n+are in active use or not. It is not intended for BIPs to list additional implementations beyond the reference\n+implementation: the BIP repository is not a signpost where to find implementations.[^OtherImplementations] After a BIP\n+is advanced to Complete, it is up to the bitcoin community to evaluate, adopt, ignore, or reject a BIP. Individual\n+bitcoin projects are encouraged to publish a list of BIPs they implement. A good example of this at the time of writing\n+this BIP can be observed in Bitcoin Coreâ€™s [doc/bips.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/bips.md)\n+file.\n+\n+### Transferring BIP Ownership\n+\n+It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of BIPs to new owners. In general, it would be preferable to\n+retain the original authors of the transferred BIP, but that is up to the original authors. A good reason to transfer\n+ownership is because the original authors no longer have the time or interest in updating it or following through with\n+the BIP process, or have fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. are unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason\n+to transfer ownership is because someone doesn't agree with the direction of the BIP. The community tries to build\n+consensus around a BIP, but if that's not possible, rather than fighting over control, the dissenters should supply a\n+competing BIP.\n+\n+If someone is interested in assuming ownership of a BIP, they should send an email asking to take over, addressed to the\n+original authors, the BIPâ€¯Editors, and the Bitcoin Development Mailing List. If the authors do not respond in a timely\n+manner (e.g. two weeks), the BIP editors will make a unilateral decision whether to appoint the applicants as\n+[Shepherds](#authors-and-shepherds) (which may be amended should the original authors make a delayed reappearance).\n+\n+## BIP Licensing\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+Each new BIP must identify at least one acceptable license in its preamble. Licenses must be referenced per their\n+respective [SPDX License identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses). New BIPs may be accepted with the licenses described\n+below.\n+\n+For example, a preamble might include the following License header:\n+\n+    License: CC0-1.0\n+             GNU-All-Permissive\n+\n+In this case, the BIP text is fully licensed under both the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license as well as the\n+GNU All-Permissive License, and anyone may modify and redistribute the text provided they comply with the terms of\n+*either* license. In other words, the license list is an \"OR choice\", not an \"AND also\" requirement.\n+\n+It is also possible to license source code differently from the BIP text by including the optional License-Code header\n+after the License header. Again, each license must be referenced by their respective SPDX License identifier shown\n+below.\n+\n+Each source code file or source directory should specify the license under which it is made available as is common in\n+software (e.g. with a license header or a LICENSE/COPYING file). It is recommended to make any test vectors available\n+under CC0-1.0 or GNU-All-Permissive in addition to any other licenses to allow anyone to copy test vectors into their\n+implementations without introducing license hindrances. Licenses listed in the License-Code header apply to all source\n+directories, source code files, and test vectors provided with the BIP except those where a LICENSE file in a directory\n+or the file header states otherwise.\n+\n+For example, a preamble specifying the optional License-Code header might look like:\n+\n+    License:         CC0-1.0\n+    License-Code:    MIT\n+\n+In this case, the code in the BIP is not available under CC0-1.0, but is only available under the terms of the MIT\n+License.\n+\n+BIPs are not required to be *exclusively* licensed under approved terms, and may also be licensed under unacceptable\n+licenses *in addition to* at least one acceptable license. In this case, only the acceptable license(s) should be listed\n+in the License and License-Code headers.\n+\n+It is recommended that BIPs that include literal code be licensed under the same license terms as the project it\n+modifies.

Substantive discussion of ideas may be more accessible to a broader audience on the mailing list, where it\n+is also more likely to be retained by the community memory.\n+\n+If the BIP needs more work, an editor should ensure that constructive, actionable feedback is provided to the authors\n+for revision. Once the BIP is ready it should be submitted as a \"pull request\" to the [BIPs\n+repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) where it may get further feedback.\n+\n+For each new BIP pull request that comes in, an editor checks the following:\n+\n+* The idea has been previously discussed on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List\n+* Title accurately describes the content\n+* Proposal is of general interest and/or pertains to more than one bitcoin project/implementation\n+* Document is properly formatted\n+* Licensing terms are acceptable\n+* Motivation, Rationale, and Backward Compatibility have been addressed\n+* Specification provides sufficient detail for implementation\n+* The defined Layer header must be correctly assigned for the given specification\n+* The BIP is ready: it is comprehensible, technically feasible, and all aspects are addressed as necessary\n+\n+Editors do NOT evaluate whether the proposal is likely to be adopted.\n+\n+A BIP editor will:\n+\n+* Assign a BIP number and BIP type in the pull request\n+* Merge the pull request when it is ready\n+* List the BIP in the [README](README.mediawiki)\n+\n+The BIP editors are intended to fulfill administrative and editorial responsibilities. The BIP editors monitor BIP\n+changes, and update BIP headers as appropriate.\n+\n+BIP editors may also, at their option, unilaterally make and merge strictly editorial changes to BIPs, such as\n+correcting misspellings, fixing broken links, etc. as long as they do not change the meaning or conflict with the\n+original intent of the authors. Such a change must be recorded in the Changelog if itâ€™s noteworthy per the criteria\n+mentioned in the [Changelog](#changelog) section.\n+\n+## Backward Compatibility\n+\n+### Changes from BIPâ€¯2\n+\n+- Introduce Shepherds and optional Shepherds header\n+- Rename \"Author\" field to \"Authors\"\n+- Refer to the proposers of a BIP as \"authors\" throughout the document.\n+- The Standards Track type is superseded by the similar Specification type.[^standard-track]\n+- Most sections are declared optional, it is up to the authors and audience to judge whether all relevant topics have\n+  been comprehensively addressed and which topics require a designated section to do so.\n+- Layer header is optional for Specification BIPs or Informational BIPs, as it does not make sense for all BIPs.[^layer]\n+- The comment system is abolished. Comments-URI and Comment-Summary headers are dropped from the preamble, Comments as\n+  an aspect of the process are discontinued.[^comments]\n+- Process BIPs are living documents that do not ossify and may be modified indefinitely.\n+- Titles may now be up to 50 characters.\n+- The Discussions-To header is dropped as it has never been used in any BIP.\n+- The Post-History header is replaced with the Discussion header.\n+- The Status field is no longer modeled around the workflow of consensus changes.\n+- Status field values are reduced from nine to four:\n+  - Deferred, Obsolete, Rejected, Replaced, and Withdrawn are gathered up into Closed.[^closed]\n+  - Final and Active are collapsed into Deployed.\n+  - The remaining statuses are Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed.\n+- BIPs no longer get rejected solely on grounds of not making progress for three years.[^rejection]\n+- A BIP may be set to Closed by its authors, or by anyone if it appears to have stopped making progress for at least a\n+  year and its authors do not assert that they are still working on it when contacted.\n+- Many judgment calls previously required from BIP Editors are reassigned either to the BIP authors or the repositoryâ€™s\n+  audience.\n+- Tracking of adoption, acceptance, and community consensus is out of scope for the BIP repository, except to determine\n+  whether a BIP is in active use for the move into or out of the Deployed status.\n+- \"Other Implementations\" sections are discouraged.[^OtherImplementations]\n+- Auxiliary files are only permitted in the corresponding BIPâ€™s subdirectory, as no one used the alternative of labeling\n+  them with the BIP number.\n+- The set of acceptable licenses was reduced to the ones previously used, and the distinction between recommended and\n+  acceptable licenses was dropped\n+\n+### Updates to existing BIPs should this BIP be activated\n+\n+#### Previous BIP Process\n+\n+This BIP supersedes BIPâ€¯2 as the guideline for the BIPâ€¯process.\n+\n+#### BIP types\n+\n+Standards Track BIPs and eligible Informational BIPs are assigned the Specification type. The Standards Track type is\n+considered obsolete. Specification BIPs use the Layer header rules specified in [BIPâ€¯123](BIP-0123.mediawiki).\n+\n+#### Comments\n+\n+The Comments-URI and Comment-Summary headers should be removed from all BIPs whose comment page in the wiki is empty.\n+For existing BIPs whose comment page has content, BIP Authors may keep both headers or remove both headers at their\n+discretion. It is recommended that existing wiki pages are not modified due to the activation of this BIP.\n+\n+#### Status field\n+\n+After the activation of this BIP, the Status fields of existing BIPs that do not fit the specification in this BIP are\n+updated to the corresponding values prescribed in this BIP.\n+\n+#### Authors header\n+\n+The Author header is replaced with the Authors header in all BIPs.\n+\n+#### Shepherds header\n+\n+The optional Shepherds header is introduced to distinguish the original authors of a BIP from later successors.\n+\n+#### Discussion header\n+\n+The Post-History header is replaced with the Discussion header in all BIPs.\n+\n+#### Licenses\n+\n+The licenses of existing BIPs remain untouched.\n+\n+## Copyright\n+\n+This BIP is licensed under the [BSD-2-Clause License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause).

Due to Informational\n+    BIPs being described as optional, Standards Track BIPs were sometimes misunderstood to be generally recommended.\n+    This has led to a number of BIPs that propose new features affecting interoperability of implementations being\n+    assigned the Informational type. The situation is remedied by introducing a new _Specification BIP_ type that is\n+    inclusive of any BIPs that can be implemented and affect interoperability of bitcoin applications. Since all BIPs\n+    are individual recommendations by the authors (even if some may eventually achieve endorsement by the majority of\n+    the community), the prior reminder that Informational BIPs are optional is dropped.\n+[^comments]: **Why were comments, Comments-URI, and Comment-Summary removed from the process?**  \n+    The comments feature saw insignificant adoption. Few BIPs received any comments and barely any more than two with\n+    only a handful of contributors commenting at all. This led to many situations in which one or two comments ended up\n+    dominating the comment summary. While some of those comments may have been representative of broadly held opinions,\n+    it also overstated the importance of individual comments directly in the Preamble of BIPs. As collecting feedback in\n+    this accessible fashion failed, the new process puts the onus back on the audience to make their own evaluation.\n+[^layer]: **Why is the layer header now permitted for other BIP types?**  \n+    The layer header had already been used by many Informational BIPs, so the rule that it is only available to\n+    Standards Track BIPs is dropped.\n+[^OtherImplementations]: **What is the issue with \"Other Implementations\" sections in BIPs?**  \n+    In the past, some BIPs had \"Other Implementations\" sections that caused frequent change requests to existing BIPs.\n+    This put an onus on the BIP authors, and frequently led to lingering pull requests due to the corresponding BIPsâ€™\n+    authors no longer participating in the process. Many of these alternative implementations eventually became\n+    unmaintained or were low-quality to begin with. Therefore, \"Other Implementations\" sections are heavily discouraged.\n+[^complete]: **Why was the Proposed status renamed to Complete?**  \n+    Some reviewers of this BIP raised that in a process which outlines the workflow of Bitcoin Improvement _Proposals_\n+    using \"Proposed\" as a status field value was overloading the term: clearly _proposals_ are proposed at all stages of\n+    the process. \"Complete\" expresses that the authors have concluded planned work on all parts of the proposal and are\n+    ready to recommend their BIP for adoption. The term \"ready\" was also considered, but considered too subjective.\n+[^rejection]: **Why can proposals remain in Draft or Complete indefinitely?**  \n+    The automatic 3-year timeout of BIPs has led to some disagreement in the past and seems unnecessary in cases where\n+    the authors are still active in the community and still considers their idea worth pursuing. On the other hand,\n+    proposals that appear stale may be tested and cleared out after only one year which should achieve the main goal of\n+    the original rule.\n+[^closed]: **Why was the Closed Status introduced?**  \n+    Previously, the process had Deferred, Obsolete, Rejected, Replaced, and Withdrawn which all meant some flavor of\n+    \"work has stopped on this\". The many statuses complicated the process, may have contributed to process fatigue, and\n+    may have resulted in BIPsâ€™ statuses not being maintained well. The author of this BIP feels that all of the\n+    aforementioned can be represented by _Closed_ without significantly impacting the information quality of the\n+    overview table. Where the many Status variants provided minuscule additional information, the simplification is more\n+    valuable and the Changelog section now collects specific details.\n+[^acceptance]: **Why does the BIP repository no longer track adoption?**  \n+    BIPâ€¯2 made an attempt to gather community feedback into comment summaries in BIPs directly. Given the low adoption\n+    and corresponding low information quality of the summaries that resulted from that feature, this BIP instead intends\n+    to leave the evaluation of BIPs to the audience.\n+[^markdown]: **Which flavor of markdown is allowed?**  \n+    The author of this proposal has no opinion on Markdown flavors, but recommends that proposals stick to the basic\n+    Markdown syntax features commonly shared across Markdown dialects.\n+[^living-documents]: **Why are Process BIPs living documents?**  \n+    In the past years, the existing BIPs process has not always provided a clear approach to all situations. For\n+    example, the content of BIPâ€¯2 appears to have been penned especially with fork proposals in mind. It seems clear\n+    that bitcoin development will evolve in many surprising ways in the future. Instead of mandating the effort of\n+    writing a new process document every time new situations arise, it seems preferable to allow the process to adapt to\n+    the concerns of the future in specific aspects. Therefore, Process BIPs are defined as living documents that remain\n+    open to amendment. If a Process BIP requires large modifications or even a complete overhaul, a new BIP should be\n+    preferred.\n+[^new-BIP]: **Why should the specification of an implemented BIP no longer be changed?**  \n+    After a Complete or Deployed BIP have been deployed by one or more implementations, breaking changes to the",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up to\n+the relevant project directly.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors what issues may arise in its progression. After some investigation,\n+the novelty of an idea can be tested by posting about it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). Prior correspondence can be found in the [mailing list\n+archive](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/).\n+\n+Vetting an idea publicly before investing the time to formally describe the idea is meant to save both the authors and\n+the broader community time. Not only may someone point out relevant discussion topics that were missed in the authorsâ€™\n+research, or that an idea is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions, but describing an idea publicly also\n+tests whether it is of interest to more people besides the authors. After establishing that the idea may be of interest\n+to the bitcoin community, the authors should work on drafting a BIP.\n+\n+As a first sketch of the proposal is taking shape, the authors should present it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). This gives the authors a chance to collect initial feedback and address\n+fundamental concerns. If the authors wish to work in public on the proposal at this stage, it is recommended that they\n+open a pull request against one of their forks of the BIP repository instead of the main BIP repository.\n+\n+It is recommended that complicated proposals be split into separate BIPs that each focus on a specific component of the\n+overall proposal.\n+\n+### Progression through BIP Statuses\n+\n+The following sections refer to BIP Status Field values. The BIP Status Field is defined in the Header Preamble\n+specification above.\n+\n+#### Draft\n+\n+After fleshing out the proposal further and ensuring that it is of high quality and properly formatted, the authors\n+should open a pull request to the [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips). The document must adhere to the\n+formatting requirements specified below and should be provided as a file named with a working title of the form\n+\"bip-title.[md|mediawiki]\". The authors must not self-assign a number to their proposal.\n+\n+BIPs that (1) adhere to the formatting requirements, (2) are on-topic, and (3) have materially progressed beyond the\n+ideation phase, e.g. by generating substantial public discussion and commentary from diverse contributors, by\n+independent bitcoin projects working on adopting the proposal, or by the authors working for an extended period toward\n+improving the proposal based on community feedback, will be assigned a number by a BIP editor. The BIP editors should\n+delay number assignment when they perceive a proposal being met with lack of interest: number assignment facilitates the\n+distributed discussion of ideas, but before a proposal garners some interest in the bitcoin community, there is no need\n+to refer to it by a number.\n+\n+Proposals are also not ready for number assignment if they duplicate efforts, disregard formatting rules, are too\n+unfocused or too broad, fail to provide proper motivation, fail to address backwards compatibility where necessary, or\n+fail to specify the feature clearly and comprehensively. Reviewers and BIP editors should provide guidance on how the\n+proposal may be improved to progress toward readiness. Pull requests that are proposing off-topic or unserious ideas or\n+have stopped to make progress may be closed.\n+\n+When the proposal is ready and has been assigned a number, a BIP editor will merge it into the BIP repository. After the\n+BIP has been merged to the repository, its main focus should no longer shift significantly, even while the authors may\n+continue to update the proposal as necessary. Updates to merged documents by the authors should also be submitted as\n+pull requests.\n+\n+#### Complete[^complete]\n+\n+When the authors have concluded all planned work on their proposal, are confident that their BIP represents a net\n+improvement, is clear, comprehensive, has a working reference implementation and test vectors (if applicable), and is\n+ready for adoption by the bitcoin community, they may update the BIPâ€™s status to Complete to indicate that they\n+recommend adoption, implementation, or deployment of the BIP. Where applicable, the authors must ensure that any\n+proposed specification is solid, not unduly complicated, and definitive. Subsequently, the BIPâ€™s content should only be\n+adjusted in minor details, e.g. to improve language, clarify ambiguities, backfill omissions in the specification, add\n+test vectors for edge cases, or address other issues discovered as the BIP is being adopted.\n+\n+A Complete BIP can only move to Deployed or Closed. Any necessary changes to the specification should be minimal and\n+interfere as little as possible with ongoing adoption. If a Complete BIP is found to need substantial functional\n+changes, it may be preferable to move it to Closed[^new-BIP], and to start a new BIP with the changes instead.\n+Otherwise, it could cause confusion as to what being compliant with the BIP means.\n+\n+Complete is the final state for most successful Informational BIPs.\n+\n+#### Deployed\n+\n+A settled[^settled] BIP may be advanced to Deployed upon request by any community member with evidence that the idea\n+described in the BIP is in active use. Such evidence includes for example: at least one project having deployed support\n+for the BIP in mainnet software releases, a soft fork proposalâ€™s activation criteria having been met on the network, or\n+rough consensus for the BIP having been demonstrated.\n+\n+At that point, the BIP should be considered final and any breaking changes to the BIP should be proposed as a new\n+separate BIP.[^new-BIP]\n+\n+##### Process BIPs\n+\n+A Process BIP may change status from Complete to Deployed when it achieves rough consensus on the mailing list. Such a\n+proposal is said to have rough consensus if it has been open to discussion on the development mailing list for at least\n+one month, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it. Addressed or obstructive objections\n+may be ignored/overruled by general agreement that they have been sufficiently addressed, but clear reasoning must be\n+given in such circumstances. Deployed Process BIPs may be modified indefinitely as long as a proposed modification has\n+rough consensus per the same criteria.[^living-documents]\n+\n+#### Closed[^closed]\n+\n+A BIP that is _not in active use_, may be labeled Closed when its authors have stopped working on it, no longer\n+recommend the proposed approach, or no longer pursue adoption of their Complete proposal. The reason for moving the\n+proposal to Closed should be recorded in the Changelog section in the same commit that updates the status.\n+\n+##### Draft â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIP authors may decide on their own to change their BIPâ€™s status from Draft to Closed. If a Draft BIP stops making\n+progress, sees accumulated feedback unaddressed, or otherwise appears stalled for a year, the community may move the BIP\n+to Closed unless the authors assert that they intend to continue work when contacted.\n+\n+##### Complete â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIPs that had attained the Complete status, i.e. that had been recommended for adoption, may be moved to Closed per the\n+authorsâ€™ announcement to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List after not being opposed within four weeks. To successfully\n+oppose the move, at least one of the opposers must volunteer to become the BIPâ€™s author or shepherd for the BIP to\n+remain Complete. A BIP can also be moved to Closed by the community if it has had Complete status for at least one year,\n+there is no evidence of it being in active use, and its authors do not object or fail to respond, unless a new author\n+volunteers within four weeks.\n+\n+##### Deployed â†¦ Closed\n+\n+A BIP may evolve from Deployed to Closed when it is no longer in active use. Any community member may initiate this\n+Status update by announcing it to the mailing list, and proceed if no objections have been raised for four weeks.\n+\n+##### Closed â†¦ Draft\n+\n+The Closed status is generally intended to be a final status for BIPs.\n+\n+If BIP authors decide to make another attempt at a previously Closed BIP, it is generally recommended to create a new\n+proposal. (Obviously, the authors may borrow any amount of inspiration or actual text from any prior BIPs as licensing\n+permits.) The authors should take special care to address the issues that caused the prior attemptâ€™s abandonment. Even\n+if the prior attempt had been assigned a number, the new BIP will generally be assigned a distinct number, unless it is\n+obvious that the new attempt directly continues work on the same idea, in which case it may be reasonable to return the\n+Closed BIP to Draft status.\n+\n+### Changelog\n+\n+To help implementers understand updates to a BIP, any changes after it has reached Complete are tracked with version,\n+date, and description in a Changelog section. The version number is inspired by semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).\n+The MAJOR version is incremented if changes to the BIPâ€™s Specification are introduced that are incompatible with prior\n+versions (which should be rare after a BIP is Complete, and only happen in well-grounded exceptional cases to a BIP that\n+is Deployed). The MINOR version is incremented whenever the specification of the BIP is changed or extended in a\n+backward-compatible way. The PATCH version is incremented for other changes to the BIP that are noteworthy (bug fixes,\n+test vectors, important clarifications, etc.). The version should start at 1.0.0 with the date the BIP was promoted to\n+Complete. An example of a Changelog section can be seen in\n+[BIPâ€¯352](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0352.mediawiki). After a BIP receives a Changelog, the\n+Preamble must indicate the latest version in the Revision header.\n+\n+### Adoption of proposals\n+\n+The BIP repository does not track the sentiment on proposals and does not track the adoption of BIPs beyond whether they\n+are in active use or not. It is not intended for BIPs to list additional implementations beyond the reference\n+implementation: the BIP repository is not a signpost where to find implementations.[^OtherImplementations] After a BIP\n+is advanced to Complete, it is up to the bitcoin community to evaluate, adopt, ignore, or reject a BIP. Individual\n+bitcoin projects are encouraged to publish a list of BIPs they implement. A good example of this at the time of writing\n+this BIP can be observed in Bitcoin Coreâ€™s [doc/bips.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/bips.md)\n+file.\n+\n+### Transferring BIP Ownership\n+\n+It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of BIPs to new owners. In general, it would be preferable to\n+retain the original authors of the transferred BIP, but that is up to the original authors. A good reason to transfer\n+ownership is because the original authors no longer have the time or interest in updating it or following through with\n+the BIP process, or have fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. are unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason\n+to transfer ownership is because someone doesn't agree with the direction of the BIP. The community tries to build\n+consensus around a BIP, but if that's not possible, rather than fighting over control, the dissenters should supply a\n+competing BIP.\n+\n+If someone is interested in assuming ownership of a BIP, they should send an email asking to take over, addressed to the\n+original authors, the BIPâ€¯Editors, and the Bitcoin Development Mailing List. If the authors do not respond in a timely\n+manner (e.g. two weeks), the BIP editors will make a unilateral decision whether to appoint the applicants as\n+[Shepherds](#authors-and-shepherds) (which may be amended should the original authors make a delayed reappearance).\n+\n+## BIP Licensing\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+Each new BIP must identify at least one acceptable license in its preamble. Licenses must be referenced per their\n+respective [SPDX License identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses). New BIPs may be accepted with the licenses described\n+below.\n+\n+For example, a preamble might include the following License header:\n+\n+    License: CC0-1.0\n+             GNU-All-Permissive\n+\n+In this case, the BIP text is fully licensed under both the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license as well as the\n+GNU All-Permissive License, and anyone may modify and redistribute the text provided they comply with the terms of\n+*either* license. In other words, the license list is an \"OR choice\", not an \"AND also\" requirement.\n+\n+It is also possible to license source code differently from the BIP text by including the optional License-Code header\n+after the License header. Again, each license must be referenced by their respective SPDX License identifier shown\n+below.\n+\n+Each source code file or source directory should specify the license under which it is made available as is common in\n+software (e.g. with a license header or a LICENSE/COPYING file). It is recommended to make any test vectors available\n+under CC0-1.0 or GNU-All-Permissive in addition to any other licenses to allow anyone to copy test vectors into their\n+implementations without introducing license hindrances. Licenses listed in the License-Code header apply to all source\n+directories, source code files, and test vectors provided with the BIP except those where a LICENSE file in a directory\n+or the file header states otherwise.\n+\n+For example, a preamble specifying the optional License-Code header might look like:\n+\n+    License:         CC0-1.0\n+    License-Code:    MIT\n+\n+In this case, the code in the BIP is not available under CC0-1.0, but is only available under the terms of the MIT\n+License.\n+\n+BIPs are not required to be *exclusively* licensed under approved terms, and may also be licensed under unacceptable\n+licenses *in addition to* at least one acceptable license. In this case, only the acceptable license(s) should be listed\n+in the License and License-Code headers.\n+\n+It is recommended that BIPs that include literal code be licensed under the same license terms as the project it\n+modifies. For example, literal code intended for Bitcoin Core would ideally be licensed (or dual-licensed) under the MIT\n+license terms.\n+\n+In all cases, details of the licensing terms must be provided in the Copyright section of the BIP.\n+\n+#### Acceptable licenses[^licenses]\n+\n+* BSD-2-Clause: [OSI-approved BSD 2-clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)\n+* BSD-3-Clause: [OSI-approved BSD 3-clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)\n+* CC0-1.0: [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\n+* GNU-All-Permissive: [GNU All-Permissive License](http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/License-Notices-for-Other-Files.html)\n+* CC-BY-4.0: [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n+* CC-BY-SA-4.0: [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)\n+* MIT: [Expat/MIT/X11 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n+\n+#### Not acceptable licenses\n+\n+All licenses not explicitly included in the above lists are not acceptable terms for a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal.\n+However, BIPs predating the acceptance of this BIP were allowed under other terms, and should use these abbreviations\n+when no other license is granted:\n+\n+* PD: Released into the public domain\n+* OPL: [Open Publication License, version 1.0](http://opencontent.org/openpub/)\n+\n+## BIP Editors\n+\n+The current BIP editors are:\n+\n+* Bryan Bishop ([kanzure@gmail.com](mailto:kanzure@gmail.com))\n+* Jon Atack ([jon@atack.com](mailto:jon@atack.com))\n+* Luke Dashjr ([luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org](mailto:luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org))\n+* Mark \"Murch\" Erhardt ([murch@murch.one](mailto:murch@murch.one))\n+* Olaoluwa Osuntokun ([laolu32@gmail.com](mailto:laolu32@gmail.com))\n+* Ruben Somsen ([rsomsen@gmail.com](mailto:rsomsen@gmail.com))\n+\n+### BIP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow\n+\n+The BIP editors subscribe to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List and watch the [BIPs\n+repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips).\n+\n+When a new BIP idea is submitted to the mailing list, BIP editors and other community members should comment in regard\n+to:\n+\n+* Novelty of the idea\n+* Viability, utility, and relevance of the concept\n+* Readiness of the proposal\n+* On-topic for the bitcoin community\n+\n+Discussion in pull request comments can often be hard to follow as feedback gets marked as resolved when it is addressed\n+by authors. Substantive discussion of ideas may be more accessible to a broader audience on the mailing list, where it\n+is also more likely to be retained by the community memory.\n+\n+If the BIP needs more work, an editor should ensure that constructive, actionable feedback is provided to the authors\n+for revision. Once the BIP is ready it should be submitted as a \"pull request\" to the [BIPs\n+repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) where it may get further feedback.\n+\n+For each new BIP pull request that comes in, an editor checks the following:\n+\n+* The idea has been previously discussed on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List\n+* Title accurately describes the content\n+* Proposal is of general interest and/or pertains to more than one bitcoin project/implementation\n+* Document is properly formatted\n+* Licensing terms are acceptable\n+* Motivation, Rationale, and Backward Compatibility have been addressed\n+* Specification provides sufficient detail for implementation\n+* The defined Layer header must be correctly assigned for the given specification\n+* The BIP is ready: it is comprehensible, technically feasible, and all aspects are addressed as necessary\n+\n+Editors do NOT evaluate whether the proposal is likely to be adopted.\n+\n+A BIP editor will:\n+\n+* Assign a BIP number and BIP type in the pull request\n+* Merge the pull request when it is ready\n+* List the BIP in the [README](README.mediawiki)",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up to\n+the relevant project directly.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors what issues may arise in its progression. After some investigation,\n+the novelty of an idea can be tested by posting about it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). Prior correspondence can be found in the [mailing list\n+archive](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/).\n+\n+Vetting an idea publicly before investing the time to formally describe the idea is meant to save both the authors and\n+the broader community time. Not only may someone point out relevant discussion topics that were missed in the authorsâ€™\n+research, or that an idea is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions, but describing an idea publicly also\n+tests whether it is of interest to more people besides the authors. After establishing that the idea may be of interest\n+to the bitcoin community, the authors should work on drafting a BIP.\n+\n+As a first sketch of the proposal is taking shape, the authors should present it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). This gives the authors a chance to collect initial feedback and address\n+fundamental concerns. If the authors wish to work in public on the proposal at this stage, it is recommended that they\n+open a pull request against one of their forks of the BIP repository instead of the main BIP repository.\n+\n+It is recommended that complicated proposals be split into separate BIPs that each focus on a specific component of the\n+overall proposal.\n+\n+### Progression through BIP Statuses\n+\n+The following sections refer to BIP Status Field values. The BIP Status Field is defined in the Header Preamble\n+specification above.\n+\n+#### Draft\n+\n+After fleshing out the proposal further and ensuring that it is of high quality and properly formatted, the authors\n+should open a pull request to the [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips). The document must adhere to the\n+formatting requirements specified below and should be provided as a file named with a working title of the form\n+\"bip-title.[md|mediawiki]\". The authors must not self-assign a number to their proposal.\n+\n+BIPs that (1) adhere to the formatting requirements, (2) are on-topic, and (3) have materially progressed beyond the\n+ideation phase, e.g. by generating substantial public discussion and commentary from diverse contributors, by\n+independent bitcoin projects working on adopting the proposal, or by the authors working for an extended period toward\n+improving the proposal based on community feedback, will be assigned a number by a BIP editor. The BIP editors should\n+delay number assignment when they perceive a proposal being met with lack of interest: number assignment facilitates the\n+distributed discussion of ideas, but before a proposal garners some interest in the bitcoin community, there is no need\n+to refer to it by a number.\n+\n+Proposals are also not ready for number assignment if they duplicate efforts, disregard formatting rules, are too\n+unfocused or too broad, fail to provide proper motivation, fail to address backwards compatibility where necessary, or\n+fail to specify the feature clearly and comprehensively. Reviewers and BIP editors should provide guidance on how the\n+proposal may be improved to progress toward readiness. Pull requests that are proposing off-topic or unserious ideas or\n+have stopped to make progress may be closed.\n+\n+When the proposal is ready and has been assigned a number, a BIP editor will merge it into the BIP repository. After the\n+BIP has been merged to the repository, its main focus should no longer shift significantly, even while the authors may\n+continue to update the proposal as necessary. Updates to merged documents by the authors should also be submitted as\n+pull requests.\n+\n+#### Complete[^complete]\n+\n+When the authors have concluded all planned work on their proposal, are confident that their BIP represents a net\n+improvement, is clear, comprehensive, has a working reference implementation and test vectors (if applicable), and is\n+ready for adoption by the bitcoin community, they may update the BIPâ€™s status to Complete to indicate that they\n+recommend adoption, implementation, or deployment of the BIP. Where applicable, the authors must ensure that any\n+proposed specification is solid, not unduly complicated, and definitive. Subsequently, the BIPâ€™s content should only be\n+adjusted in minor details, e.g. to improve language, clarify ambiguities, backfill omissions in the specification, add\n+test vectors for edge cases, or address other issues discovered as the BIP is being adopted.\n+\n+A Complete BIP can only move to Deployed or Closed. Any necessary changes to the specification should be minimal and\n+interfere as little as possible with ongoing adoption. If a Complete BIP is found to need substantial functional\n+changes, it may be preferable to move it to Closed[^new-BIP], and to start a new BIP with the changes instead.\n+Otherwise, it could cause confusion as to what being compliant with the BIP means.\n+\n+Complete is the final state for most successful Informational BIPs.\n+\n+#### Deployed\n+\n+A settled[^settled] BIP may be advanced to Deployed upon request by any community member with evidence that the idea\n+described in the BIP is in active use. Such evidence includes for example: at least one project having deployed support\n+for the BIP in mainnet software releases, a soft fork proposalâ€™s activation criteria having been met on the network, or\n+rough consensus for the BIP having been demonstrated.\n+\n+At that point, the BIP should be considered final and any breaking changes to the BIP should be proposed as a new\n+separate BIP.[^new-BIP]\n+\n+##### Process BIPs\n+\n+A Process BIP may change status from Complete to Deployed when it achieves rough consensus on the mailing list. Such a\n+proposal is said to have rough consensus if it has been open to discussion on the development mailing list for at least\n+one month, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it. Addressed or obstructive objections\n+may be ignored/overruled by general agreement that they have been sufficiently addressed, but clear reasoning must be\n+given in such circumstances. Deployed Process BIPs may be modified indefinitely as long as a proposed modification has\n+rough consensus per the same criteria.[^living-documents]\n+\n+#### Closed[^closed]\n+\n+A BIP that is _not in active use_, may be labeled Closed when its authors have stopped working on it, no longer\n+recommend the proposed approach, or no longer pursue adoption of their Complete proposal. The reason for moving the\n+proposal to Closed should be recorded in the Changelog section in the same commit that updates the status.\n+\n+##### Draft â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIP authors may decide on their own to change their BIPâ€™s status from Draft to Closed. If a Draft BIP stops making\n+progress, sees accumulated feedback unaddressed, or otherwise appears stalled for a year, the community may move the BIP\n+to Closed unless the authors assert that they intend to continue work when contacted.\n+\n+##### Complete â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIPs that had attained the Complete status, i.e. that had been recommended for adoption, may be moved to Closed per the\n+authorsâ€™ announcement to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List after not being opposed within four weeks. To successfully\n+oppose the move, at least one of the opposers must volunteer to become the BIPâ€™s author or shepherd for the BIP to\n+remain Complete. A BIP can also be moved to Closed by the community if it has had Complete status for at least one year,\n+there is no evidence of it being in active use, and its authors do not object or fail to respond, unless a new author\n+volunteers within four weeks.\n+\n+##### Deployed â†¦ Closed\n+\n+A BIP may evolve from Deployed to Closed when it is no longer in active use. Any community member may initiate this\n+Status update by announcing it to the mailing list, and proceed if no objections have been raised for four weeks.\n+\n+##### Closed â†¦ Draft\n+\n+The Closed status is generally intended to be a final status for BIPs.\n+\n+If BIP authors decide to make another attempt at a previously Closed BIP, it is generally recommended to create a new\n+proposal. (Obviously, the authors may borrow any amount of inspiration or actual text from any prior BIPs as licensing\n+permits.) The authors should take special care to address the issues that caused the prior attemptâ€™s abandonment. Even\n+if the prior attempt had been assigned a number, the new BIP will generally be assigned a distinct number, unless it is\n+obvious that the new attempt directly continues work on the same idea, in which case it may be reasonable to return the\n+Closed BIP to Draft status.\n+\n+### Changelog\n+\n+To help implementers understand updates to a BIP, any changes after it has reached Complete are tracked with version,\n+date, and description in a Changelog section. The version number is inspired by semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).\n+The MAJOR version is incremented if changes to the BIPâ€™s Specification are introduced that are incompatible with prior\n+versions (which should be rare after a BIP is Complete, and only happen in well-grounded exceptional cases to a BIP that\n+is Deployed). The MINOR version is incremented whenever the specification of the BIP is changed or extended in a\n+backward-compatible way. The PATCH version is incremented for other changes to the BIP that are noteworthy (bug fixes,\n+test vectors, important clarifications, etc.). The version should start at 1.0.0 with the date the BIP was promoted to\n+Complete. An example of a Changelog section can be seen in\n+[BIPâ€¯352](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0352.mediawiki). After a BIP receives a Changelog, the\n+Preamble must indicate the latest version in the Revision header.\n+\n+### Adoption of proposals\n+\n+The BIP repository does not track the sentiment on proposals and does not track the adoption of BIPs beyond whether they\n+are in active use or not. It is not intended for BIPs to list additional implementations beyond the reference\n+implementation: the BIP repository is not a signpost where to find implementations.[^OtherImplementations] After a BIP\n+is advanced to Complete, it is up to the bitcoin community to evaluate, adopt, ignore, or reject a BIP. Individual\n+bitcoin projects are encouraged to publish a list of BIPs they implement. A good example of this at the time of writing\n+this BIP can be observed in Bitcoin Coreâ€™s [doc/bips.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/bips.md)\n+file.\n+\n+### Transferring BIP Ownership\n+\n+It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of BIPs to new owners. In general, it would be preferable to\n+retain the original authors of the transferred BIP, but that is up to the original authors. A good reason to transfer\n+ownership is because the original authors no longer have the time or interest in updating it or following through with\n+the BIP process, or have fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. are unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason\n+to transfer ownership is because someone doesn't agree with the direction of the BIP. The community tries to build\n+consensus around a BIP, but if that's not possible, rather than fighting over control, the dissenters should supply a\n+competing BIP.\n+\n+If someone is interested in assuming ownership of a BIP, they should send an email asking to take over, addressed to the\n+original authors, the BIPâ€¯Editors, and the Bitcoin Development Mailing List. If the authors do not respond in a timely\n+manner (e.g. two weeks), the BIP editors will make a unilateral decision whether to appoint the applicants as\n+[Shepherds](#authors-and-shepherds) (which may be amended should the original authors make a delayed reappearance).\n+\n+## BIP Licensing\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+Each new BIP must identify at least one acceptable license in its preamble. Licenses must be referenced per their\n+respective [SPDX License identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses). New BIPs may be accepted with the licenses described\n+below.\n+\n+For example, a preamble might include the following License header:\n+\n+    License: CC0-1.0\n+             GNU-All-Permissive\n+\n+In this case, the BIP text is fully licensed under both the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license as well as the\n+GNU All-Permissive License, and anyone may modify and redistribute the text provided they comply with the terms of\n+*either* license. In other words, the license list is an \"OR choice\", not an \"AND also\" requirement.\n+\n+It is also possible to license source code differently from the BIP text by including the optional License-Code header\n+after the License header. Again, each license must be referenced by their respective SPDX License identifier shown\n+below.\n+\n+Each source code file or source directory should specify the license under which it is made available as is common in\n+software (e.g. with a license header or a LICENSE/COPYING file). It is recommended to make any test vectors available\n+under CC0-1.0 or GNU-All-Permissive in addition to any other licenses to allow anyone to copy test vectors into their\n+implementations without introducing license hindrances. Licenses listed in the License-Code header apply to all source\n+directories, source code files, and test vectors provided with the BIP except those where a LICENSE file in a directory\n+or the file header states otherwise.\n+\n+For example, a preamble specifying the optional License-Code header might look like:\n+\n+    License:         CC0-1.0\n+    License-Code:    MIT\n+\n+In this case, the code in the BIP is not available under CC0-1.0, but is only available under the terms of the MIT\n+License.\n+\n+BIPs are not required to be *exclusively* licensed under approved terms, and may also be licensed under unacceptable\n+licenses *in addition to* at least one acceptable license. In this case, only the acceptable license(s) should be listed\n+in the License and License-Code headers.\n+\n+It is recommended that BIPs that include literal code be licensed under the same license terms as the project it\n+modifies. For example, literal code intended for Bitcoin Core would ideally be licensed (or dual-licensed) under the MIT\n+license terms.\n+\n+In all cases, details of the licensing terms must be provided in the Copyright section of the BIP.\n+\n+#### Acceptable licenses[^licenses]\n+\n+* BSD-2-Clause: [OSI-approved BSD 2-clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)\n+* BSD-3-Clause: [OSI-approved BSD 3-clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)\n+* CC0-1.0: [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\n+* GNU-All-Permissive: [GNU All-Permissive License](http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/License-Notices-for-Other-Files.html)\n+* CC-BY-4.0: [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n+* CC-BY-SA-4.0: [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)\n+* MIT: [Expat/MIT/X11 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n+\n+#### Not acceptable licenses\n+\n+All licenses not explicitly included in the above lists are not acceptable terms for a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal.\n+However, BIPs predating the acceptance of this BIP were allowed under other terms, and should use these abbreviations\n+when no other license is granted:\n+\n+* PD: Released into the public domain\n+* OPL: [Open Publication License, version 1.0](http://opencontent.org/openpub/)\n+\n+## BIP Editors\n+\n+The current BIP editors are:\n+\n+* Bryan Bishop ([kanzure@gmail.com](mailto:kanzure@gmail.com))\n+* Jon Atack ([jon@atack.com](mailto:jon@atack.com))\n+* Luke Dashjr ([luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org](mailto:luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org))\n+* Mark \"Murch\" Erhardt ([murch@murch.one](mailto:murch@murch.one))\n+* Olaoluwa Osuntokun ([laolu32@gmail.com](mailto:laolu32@gmail.com))\n+* Ruben Somsen ([rsomsen@gmail.com](mailto:rsomsen@gmail.com))\n+\n+### BIP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow\n+\n+The BIP editors subscribe to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List and watch the [BIPs\n+repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips).\n+\n+When a new BIP idea is submitted to the mailing list, BIP editors and other community members should comment in regard\n+to:\n+\n+* Novelty of the idea\n+* Viability, utility, and relevance of the concept\n+* Readiness of the proposal\n+* On-topic for the bitcoin community\n+\n+Discussion in pull request comments can often be hard to follow as feedback gets marked as resolved when it is addressed\n+by authors. Substantive discussion of ideas may be more accessible to a broader audience on the mailing list, where it\n+is also more likely to be retained by the community memory.\n+\n+If the BIP needs more work, an editor should ensure that constructive, actionable feedback is provided to the authors\n+for revision. Once the BIP is ready it should be submitted as a \"pull request\" to the [BIPs\n+repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) where it may get further feedback.\n+\n+For each new BIP pull request that comes in, an editor checks the following:\n+\n+* The idea has been previously discussed on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List\n+* Title accurately describes the content\n+* Proposal is of general interest and/or pertains to more than one bitcoin project/implementation\n+* Document is properly formatted\n+* Licensing terms are acceptable\n+* Motivation, Rationale, and Backward Compatibility have been addressed\n+* Specification provides sufficient detail for implementation\n+* The defined Layer header must be correctly assigned for the given specification\n+* The BIP is ready: it is comprehensible, technically feasible, and all aspects are addressed as necessary\n+\n+Editors do NOT evaluate whether the proposal is likely to be adopted.\n+\n+A BIP editor will:\n+\n+* Assign a BIP number and BIP type in the pull request\n+* Merge the pull request when it is ready\n+* List the BIP in the [README](README.mediawiki)\n+\n+The BIP editors are intended to fulfill administrative and editorial responsibilities. The BIP editors monitor BIP\n+changes, and update BIP headers as appropriate.\n+\n+BIP editors may also, at their option, unilaterally make and merge strictly editorial changes to BIPs, such as\n+correcting misspellings, fixing broken links, etc. as long as they do not change the meaning or conflict with the\n+original intent of the authors. Such a change must be recorded in the Changelog if itâ€™s noteworthy per the criteria\n+mentioned in the [Changelog](#changelog) section.\n+\n+## Backward Compatibility\n+\n+### Changes from BIPâ€¯2",

BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>",

A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up to\n+the relevant project directly.",

Ideas in bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors what issues may arise in its progression. After some investigation,\n+the novelty of an idea can be tested by posting about it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev).

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up to\n+the relevant project directly.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors what issues may arise in its progression. After some investigation,\n+the novelty of an idea can be tested by posting about it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). Prior correspondence can be found in the [mailing list\n+archive](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/).\n+\n+Vetting an idea publicly before investing the time to formally describe the idea is meant to save both the authors and\n+the broader community time. Not only may someone point out relevant discussion topics that were missed in the authorsâ€™\n+research, or that an idea is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions, but describing an idea publicly also\n+tests whether it is of interest to more people besides the authors. After establishing that the idea may be of interest\n+to the bitcoin community, the authors should work on drafting a BIP.\n+\n+As a first sketch of the proposal is taking shape, the authors should present it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). This gives the authors a chance to collect initial feedback and address\n+fundamental concerns. If the authors wish to work in public on the proposal at this stage, it is recommended that they\n+open a pull request against one of their forks of the BIP repository instead of the main BIP repository.\n+\n+It is recommended that complicated proposals be split into separate BIPs that each focus on a specific component of the\n+overall proposal.\n+\n+### Progression through BIP Statuses\n+\n+The following sections refer to BIP Status Field values. The BIP Status Field is defined in the Header Preamble\n+specification above.\n+\n+#### Draft\n+\n+After fleshing out the proposal further and ensuring that it is of high quality and properly formatted, the authors\n+should open a pull request to the [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips). The document must adhere to the\n+formatting requirements specified below and should be provided as a file named with a working title of the form\n+\"bip-title.[md|mediawiki]\". The authors must not self-assign a number to their proposal.\n+\n+BIPs that (1) adhere to the formatting requirements, (2) are on-topic, and (3) have materially progressed beyond the\n+ideation phase, e.g. by generating substantial public discussion and commentary from diverse contributors, by\n+independent bitcoin projects working on adopting the proposal, or by the authors working for an extended period toward\n+improving the proposal based on community feedback, will be assigned a number by a BIP editor. The BIP editors should\n+delay number assignment when they perceive a proposal being met with lack of interest: number assignment facilitates the\n+distributed discussion of ideas, but before a proposal garners some interest in the bitcoin community, there is no need\n+to refer to it by a number.\n+\n+Proposals are also not ready for number assignment if they duplicate efforts, disregard formatting rules, are too\n+unfocused or too broad, fail to provide proper motivation, fail to address backwards compatibility where necessary, or\n+fail to specify the feature clearly and comprehensively. Reviewers and BIP editors should provide guidance on how the\n+proposal may be improved to progress toward readiness. Pull requests that are proposing off-topic or unserious ideas or\n+have stopped to make progress may be closed.\n+\n+When the proposal is ready and has been assigned a number, a BIP editor will merge it into the BIP repository. After the\n+BIP has been merged to the repository, its main focus should no longer shift significantly, even while the authors may\n+continue to update the proposal as necessary. Updates to merged documents by the authors should also be submitted as\n+pull requests.\n+\n+#### Complete[^complete]\n+\n+When the authors have concluded all planned work on their proposal, are confident that their BIP represents a net\n+improvement, is clear, comprehensive, has a working reference implementation and test vectors (if applicable), and is\n+ready for adoption by the bitcoin community, they may update the BIPâ€™s status to Complete to indicate that they\n+recommend adoption, implementation, or deployment of the BIP. Where applicable, the authors must ensure that any\n+proposed specification is solid, not unduly complicated, and definitive. Subsequently, the BIPâ€™s content should only be\n+adjusted in minor details, e.g. to improve language, clarify ambiguities, backfill omissions in the specification, add\n+test vectors for edge cases, or address other issues discovered as the BIP is being adopted.\n+\n+A Complete BIP can only move to Deployed or Closed. Any necessary changes to the specification should be minimal and\n+interfere as little as possible with ongoing adoption. If a Complete BIP is found to need substantial functional\n+changes, it may be preferable to move it to Closed[^new-BIP], and to start a new BIP with the changes instead.\n+Otherwise, it could cause confusion as to what being compliant with the BIP means.\n+\n+Complete is the final state for most successful Informational BIPs.\n+\n+#### Deployed\n+\n+A settled[^settled] BIP may be advanced to Deployed upon request by any community member with evidence that the idea\n+described in the BIP is in active use. Such evidence includes for example: at least one project having deployed support\n+for the BIP in mainnet software releases, a soft fork proposalâ€™s activation criteria having been met on the network, or\n+rough consensus for the BIP having been demonstrated.\n+\n+At that point, the BIP should be considered final and any breaking changes to the BIP should be proposed as a new\n+separate BIP.[^new-BIP]\n+\n+##### Process BIPs\n+\n+A Process BIP may change status from Complete to Deployed when it achieves rough consensus on the mailing list. Such a\n+proposal is said to have rough consensus if it has been open to discussion on the development mailing list for at least\n+one month, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it. Addressed or obstructive objections\n+may be ignored/overruled by general agreement that they have been sufficiently addressed, but clear reasoning must be\n+given in such circumstances. Deployed Process BIPs may be modified indefinitely as long as a proposed modification has\n+rough consensus per the same criteria.[^living-documents]\n+\n+#### Closed[^closed]\n+\n+A BIP that is _not in active use_, may be labeled Closed when its authors have stopped working on it, no longer\n+recommend the proposed approach, or no longer pursue adoption of their Complete proposal. The reason for moving the\n+proposal to Closed should be recorded in the Changelog section in the same commit that updates the status.\n+\n+##### Draft â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIP authors may decide on their own to change their BIPâ€™s status from Draft to Closed. If a Draft BIP stops making\n+progress, sees accumulated feedback unaddressed, or otherwise appears stalled for a year, the community may move the BIP\n+to Closed unless the authors assert that they intend to continue work when contacted.\n+\n+##### Complete â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIPs that had attained the Complete status, i.e. that had been recommended for adoption, may be moved to Closed per the\n+authorsâ€™ announcement to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List after not being opposed within four weeks. To successfully\n+oppose the move, at least one of the opposers must volunteer to become the BIPâ€™s author or shepherd for the BIP to\n+remain Complete. A BIP can also be moved to Closed by the community if it has had Complete status for at least one year,\n+there is no evidence of it being in active use, and its authors do not object or fail to respond, unless a new author\n+volunteers within four weeks.\n+\n+##### Deployed â†¦ Closed\n+\n+A BIP may evolve from Deployed to Closed when it is no longer in active use. Any community member may initiate this\n+Status update by announcing it to the mailing list, and proceed if no objections have been raised for four weeks.\n+\n+##### Closed â†¦ Draft\n+\n+The Closed status is generally intended to be a final status for BIPs.\n+\n+If BIP authors decide to make another attempt at a previously Closed BIP, it is generally recommended to create a new\n+proposal. (Obviously, the authors may borrow any amount of inspiration or actual text from any prior BIPs as licensing\n+permits.) The authors should take special care to address the issues that caused the prior attemptâ€™s abandonment. Even\n+if the prior attempt had been assigned a number, the new BIP will generally be assigned a distinct number, unless it is\n+obvious that the new attempt directly continues work on the same idea, in which case it may be reasonable to return the\n+Closed BIP to Draft status.\n+\n+### Changelog\n+\n+To help implementers understand updates to a BIP, any changes after it has reached Complete are tracked with version,\n+date, and description in a Changelog section. The version number is inspired by semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).\n+The MAJOR version is incremented if changes to the BIPâ€™s Specification are introduced that are incompatible with prior\n+versions (which should be rare after a BIP is Complete, and only happen in well-grounded exceptional cases to a BIP that\n+is Deployed). The MINOR version is incremented whenever the specification of the BIP is changed or extended in a\n+backward-compatible way. The PATCH version is incremented for other changes to the BIP that are noteworthy (bug fixes,\n+test vectors, important clarifications, etc.). The version should start at 1.0.0 with the date the BIP was promoted to\n+Complete. An example of a Changelog section can be seen in\n+[BIPâ€¯352](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0352.mediawiki). After a BIP receives a Changelog, the\n+Preamble must indicate the latest version in the Revision header.\n+\n+### Adoption of proposals\n+\n+The BIP repository does not track the sentiment on proposals and does not track the adoption of BIPs beyond whether they\n+are in active use or not. It is not intended for BIPs to list additional implementations beyond the reference\n+implementation: the BIP repository is not a signpost where to find implementations.[^OtherImplementations] After a BIP\n+is advanced to Complete, it is up to the bitcoin community to evaluate, adopt, ignore, or reject a BIP. Individual\n+bitcoin projects are encouraged to publish a list of BIPs they implement. A good example of this at the time of writing\n+this BIP can be observed in Bitcoin Coreâ€™s [doc/bips.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/bips.md)\n+file.\n+\n+### Transferring BIP Ownership\n+\n+It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of BIPs to new owners. In general, it would be preferable to\n+retain the original authors of the transferred BIP, but that is up to the original authors. A good reason to transfer\n+ownership is because the original authors no longer have the time or interest in updating it or following through with\n+the BIP process, or have fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. are unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason\n+to transfer ownership is because someone doesn't agree with the direction of the BIP. The community tries to build\n+consensus around a BIP, but if that's not possible, rather than fighting over control, the dissenters should supply a\n+competing BIP.\n+\n+If someone is interested in assuming ownership of a BIP, they should send an email asking to take over, addressed to the\n+original authors, the BIPâ€¯Editors, and the Bitcoin Development Mailing List. If the authors do not respond in a timely\n+manner (e.g. two weeks), the BIP editors will make a unilateral decision whether to appoint the applicants as\n+[Shepherds](#authors-and-shepherds) (which may be amended should the original authors make a delayed reappearance).\n+\n+## BIP Licensing\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+Each new BIP must identify at least one acceptable license in its preamble. Licenses must be referenced per their\n+respective [SPDX License identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses). New BIPs may be accepted with the licenses described\n+below.\n+\n+For example, a preamble might include the following License header:\n+\n+    License: CC0-1.0\n+             GNU-All-Permissive\n+\n+In this case, the BIP text is fully licensed under both the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license as well as the\n+GNU All-Permissive License, and anyone may modify and redistribute the text provided they comply with the terms of\n+*either* license. In other words, the license list is an \"OR choice\", not an \"AND also\" requirement.\n+\n+It is also possible to license source code differently from the BIP text by including the optional License-Code header\n+after the License header. Again, each license must be referenced by their respective SPDX License identifier shown\n+below.\n+\n+Each source code file or source directory should specify the license under which it is made available as is common in\n+software (e.g. with a license header or a LICENSE/COPYING file). It is recommended to make any test vectors available\n+under CC0-1.0 or GNU-All-Permissive in addition to any other licenses to allow anyone to copy test vectors into their\n+implementations without introducing license hindrances. Licenses listed in the License-Code header apply to all source\n+directories, source code files, and test vectors provided with the BIP except those where a LICENSE file in a directory\n+or the file header states otherwise.\n+\n+For example, a preamble specifying the optional License-Code header might look like:\n+\n+    License:         CC0-1.0\n+    License-Code:    MIT\n+\n+In this case, the code in the BIP is not available under CC0-1.0, but is only available under the terms of the MIT\n+License.\n+\n+BIPs are not required to be *exclusively* licensed under approved terms, and may also be licensed under unacceptable\n+licenses *in addition to* at least one acceptable license. In this case, only the acceptable license(s) should be listed\n+in the License and License-Code headers.\n+\n+It is recommended that BIPs that include literal code be licensed under the same license terms as the project it\n+modifies.

Substantive discussion of ideas may be more accessible to a broader audience on the mailing list, where it\n+is also more likely to be retained by the community memory.\n+\n+If the BIP needs more work, an editor should ensure that constructive, actionable feedback is provided to the authors\n+for revision. Once the BIP is ready it should be submitted as a \"pull request\" to the [BIPs\n+repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) where it may get further feedback.\n+\n+For each new BIP pull request that comes in, an editor checks the following:\n+\n+* The idea has been previously discussed on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List\n+* Title accurately describes the content\n+* Proposal is of general interest and/or pertains to more than one bitcoin project/implementation\n+* Document is properly formatted\n+* Licensing terms are acceptable\n+* Motivation, Rationale, and Backward Compatibility have been addressed\n+* Specification provides sufficient detail for implementation\n+* The defined Layer header must be correctly assigned for the given specification\n+* The BIP is ready: it is comprehensible, technically feasible, and all aspects are addressed as necessary\n+\n+Editors do NOT evaluate whether the proposal is likely to be adopted.\n+\n+A BIP editor will:\n+\n+* Assign a BIP number and BIP type in the pull request\n+* Merge the pull request when it is ready\n+* List the BIP in the [README](README.mediawiki)",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up to\n+the relevant project directly.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors what issues may arise in its progression. After some investigation,\n+the novelty of an idea can be tested by posting about it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). Prior correspondence can be found in the [mailing list\n+archive](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/).\n+\n+Vetting an idea publicly before investing the time to formally describe the idea is meant to save both the authors and\n+the broader community time. Not only may someone point out relevant discussion topics that were missed in the authorsâ€™\n+research, or that an idea is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions, but describing an idea publicly also\n+tests whether it is of interest to more people besides the authors. After establishing that the idea may be of interest\n+to the bitcoin community, the authors should work on drafting a BIP.\n+\n+As a first sketch of the proposal is taking shape, the authors should present it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). This gives the authors a chance to collect initial feedback and address\n+fundamental concerns. If the authors wish to work in public on the proposal at this stage, it is recommended that they\n+open a pull request against one of their forks of the BIP repository instead of the main BIP repository.\n+\n+It is recommended that complicated proposals be split into separate BIPs that each focus on a specific component of the\n+overall proposal.\n+\n+### Progression through BIP Statuses\n+\n+The following sections refer to BIP Status Field values. The BIP Status Field is defined in the Header Preamble\n+specification above.\n+\n+#### Draft\n+\n+After fleshing out the proposal further and ensuring that it is of high quality and properly formatted, the authors\n+should open a pull request to the [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips). The document must adhere to the\n+formatting requirements specified below and should be provided as a file named with a working title of the form\n+\"bip-title.[md|mediawiki]\". The authors must not self-assign a number to their proposal.\n+\n+BIPs that (1) adhere to the formatting requirements, (2) are on-topic, and (3) have materially progressed beyond the\n+ideation phase, e.g. by generating substantial public discussion and commentary from diverse contributors, by\n+independent bitcoin projects working on adopting the proposal, or by the authors working for an extended period toward\n+improving the proposal based on community feedback, will be assigned a number by a BIP editor. The BIP editors should\n+delay number assignment when they perceive a proposal being met with lack of interest: number assignment facilitates the\n+distributed discussion of ideas, but before a proposal garners some interest in the bitcoin community, there is no need\n+to refer to it by a number.\n+\n+Proposals are also not ready for number assignment if they duplicate efforts, disregard formatting rules, are too\n+unfocused or too broad, fail to provide proper motivation, fail to address backwards compatibility where necessary, or\n+fail to specify the feature clearly and comprehensively. Reviewers and BIP editors should provide guidance on how the\n+proposal may be improved to progress toward readiness. Pull requests that are proposing off-topic or unserious ideas or\n+have stopped to make progress may be closed.\n+\n+When the proposal is ready and has been assigned a number, a BIP editor will merge it into the BIP repository. After the\n+BIP has been merged to the repository, its main focus should no longer shift significantly, even while the authors may\n+continue to update the proposal as necessary. Updates to merged documents by the authors should also be submitted as\n+pull requests.\n+\n+#### Complete[^complete]\n+\n+When the authors have concluded all planned work on their proposal, are confident that their BIP represents a net\n+improvement, is clear, comprehensive, has a working reference implementation and test vectors (if applicable), and is\n+ready for adoption by the bitcoin community, they may update the BIPâ€™s status to Complete to indicate that they\n+recommend adoption, implementation, or deployment of the BIP. Where applicable, the authors must ensure that any\n+proposed specification is solid, not unduly complicated, and definitive. Subsequently, the BIPâ€™s content should only be\n+adjusted in minor details, e.g. to improve language, clarify ambiguities, backfill omissions in the specification, add\n+test vectors for edge cases, or address other issues discovered as the BIP is being adopted.\n+\n+A Complete BIP can only move to Deployed or Closed. Any necessary changes to the specification should be minimal and\n+interfere as little as possible with ongoing adoption. If a Complete BIP is found to need substantial functional\n+changes, it may be preferable to move it to Closed[^new-BIP], and to start a new BIP with the changes instead.\n+Otherwise, it could cause confusion as to what being compliant with the BIP means.\n+\n+Complete is the final state for most successful Informational BIPs.\n+\n+#### Deployed\n+\n+A settled[^settled] BIP may be advanced to Deployed upon request by any community member with evidence that the idea\n+described in the BIP is in active use. Such evidence includes for example: at least one project having deployed support\n+for the BIP in mainnet software releases, a soft fork proposalâ€™s activation criteria having been met on the network, or\n+rough consensus for the BIP having been demonstrated.\n+\n+At that point, the BIP should be considered final and any breaking changes to the BIP should be proposed as a new\n+separate BIP.[^new-BIP]\n+\n+##### Process BIPs\n+\n+A Process BIP may change status from Complete to Deployed when it achieves rough consensus on the mailing list. Such a\n+proposal is said to have rough consensus if it has been open to discussion on the development mailing list for at least\n+one month, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it. Addressed or obstructive objections\n+may be ignored/overruled by general agreement that they have been sufficiently addressed, but clear reasoning must be\n+given in such circumstances. Deployed Process BIPs may be modified indefinitely as long as a proposed modification has\n+rough consensus per the same criteria.[^living-documents]\n+\n+#### Closed[^closed]\n+\n+A BIP that is _not in active use_, may be labeled Closed when its authors have stopped working on it, no longer\n+recommend the proposed approach, or no longer pursue adoption of their Complete proposal. The reason for moving the\n+proposal to Closed should be recorded in the Changelog section in the same commit that updates the status.\n+\n+##### Draft â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIP authors may decide on their own to change their BIPâ€™s status from Draft to Closed. If a Draft BIP stops making\n+progress, sees accumulated feedback unaddressed, or otherwise appears stalled for a year, the community may move the BIP\n+to Closed unless the authors assert that they intend to continue work when contacted.\n+\n+##### Complete â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIPs that had attained the Complete status, i.e. that had been recommended for adoption, may be moved to Closed per the\n+authorsâ€™ announcement to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List after not being opposed within four weeks. To successfully\n+oppose the move, at least one of the opposers must volunteer to become the BIPâ€™s author or shepherd for the BIP to\n+remain Complete. A BIP can also be moved to Closed by the community if it has had Complete status for at least one year,\n+there is no evidence of it being in active use, and its authors do not object or fail to respond, unless a new author\n+volunteers within four weeks.\n+\n+##### Deployed â†¦ Closed\n+\n+A BIP may evolve from Deployed to Closed when it is no longer in active use. Any community member may initiate this\n+Status update by announcing it to the mailing list, and proceed if no objections have been raised for four weeks.\n+\n+##### Closed â†¦ Draft\n+\n+The Closed status is generally intended to be a final status for BIPs.\n+\n+If BIP authors decide to make another attempt at a previously Closed BIP, it is generally recommended to create a new\n+proposal. (Obviously, the authors may borrow any amount of inspiration or actual text from any prior BIPs as licensing\n+permits.) The authors should take special care to address the issues that caused the prior attemptâ€™s abandonment. Even\n+if the prior attempt had been assigned a number, the new BIP will generally be assigned a distinct number, unless it is\n+obvious that the new attempt directly continues work on the same idea, in which case it may be reasonable to return the\n+Closed BIP to Draft status.\n+\n+### Changelog\n+\n+To help implementers understand updates to a BIP, any changes after it has reached Complete are tracked with version,\n+date, and description in a Changelog section. The version number is inspired by semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).\n+The MAJOR version is incremented if changes to the BIPâ€™s Specification are introduced that are incompatible with prior\n+versions (which should be rare after a BIP is Complete, and only happen in well-grounded exceptional cases to a BIP that\n+is Deployed). The MINOR version is incremented whenever the specification of the BIP is changed or extended in a\n+backward-compatible way. The PATCH version is incremented for other changes to the BIP that are noteworthy (bug fixes,\n+test vectors, important clarifications, etc.). The version should start at 1.0.0 with the date the BIP was promoted to\n+Complete. An example of a Changelog section can be seen in\n+[BIPâ€¯352](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0352.mediawiki). After a BIP receives a Changelog, the\n+Preamble must indicate the latest version in the Revision header.\n+\n+### Adoption of proposals\n+\n+The BIP repository does not track the sentiment on proposals and does not track the adoption of BIPs beyond whether they\n+are in active use or not. It is not intended for BIPs to list additional implementations beyond the reference\n+implementation: the BIP repository is not a signpost where to find implementations.[^OtherImplementations] After a BIP\n+is advanced to Complete, it is up to the bitcoin community to evaluate, adopt, ignore, or reject a BIP. Individual\n+bitcoin projects are encouraged to publish a list of BIPs they implement. A good example of this at the time of writing\n+this BIP can be observed in Bitcoin Coreâ€™s [doc/bips.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/bips.md)\n+file.\n+\n+### Transferring BIP Ownership\n+\n+It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of BIPs to new owners. In general, it would be preferable to\n+retain the original authors of the transferred BIP, but that is up to the original authors. A good reason to transfer\n+ownership is because the original authors no longer have the time or interest in updating it or following through with\n+the BIP process, or have fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. are unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason\n+to transfer ownership is because someone doesn't agree with the direction of the BIP. The community tries to build\n+consensus around a BIP, but if that's not possible, rather than fighting over control, the dissenters should supply a\n+competing BIP.\n+\n+If someone is interested in assuming ownership of a BIP, they should send an email asking to take over, addressed to the\n+original authors, the BIPâ€¯Editors, and the Bitcoin Development Mailing List. If the authors do not respond in a timely\n+manner (e.g. two weeks), the BIP editors will make a unilateral decision whether to appoint the applicants as\n+[Shepherds](#authors-and-shepherds) (which may be amended should the original authors make a delayed reappearance).\n+\n+## BIP Licensing\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+Each new BIP must identify at least one acceptable license in its preamble. Licenses must be referenced per their\n+respective [SPDX License identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses). New BIPs may be accepted with the licenses described\n+below.\n+\n+For example, a preamble might include the following License header:\n+\n+    License: CC0-1.0\n+             GNU-All-Permissive\n+\n+In this case, the BIP text is fully licensed under both the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license as well as the\n+GNU All-Permissive License, and anyone may modify and redistribute the text provided they comply with the terms of\n+*either* license. In other words, the license list is an \"OR choice\", not an \"AND also\" requirement.\n+\n+It is also possible to license source code differently from the BIP text by including the optional License-Code header\n+after the License header. Again, each license must be referenced by their respective SPDX License identifier shown\n+below.\n+\n+Each source code file or source directory should specify the license under which it is made available as is common in\n+software (e.g. with a license header or a LICENSE/COPYING file). It is recommended to make any test vectors available\n+under CC0-1.0 or GNU-All-Permissive in addition to any other licenses to allow anyone to copy test vectors into their\n+implementations without introducing license hindrances. Licenses listed in the License-Code header apply to all source\n+directories, source code files, and test vectors provided with the BIP except those where a LICENSE file in a directory\n+or the file header states otherwise.\n+\n+For example, a preamble specifying the optional License-Code header might look like:\n+\n+    License:         CC0-1.0\n+    License-Code:    MIT\n+\n+In this case, the code in the BIP is not available under CC0-1.0, but is only available under the terms of the MIT\n+License.\n+\n+BIPs are not required to be *exclusively* licensed under approved terms, and may also be licensed under unacceptable\n+licenses *in addition to* at least one acceptable license. In this case, only the acceptable license(s) should be listed\n+in the License and License-Code headers.\n+\n+It is recommended that BIPs that include literal code be licensed under the same license terms as the project it\n+modifies. For example, literal code intended for Bitcoin Core would ideally be licensed (or dual-licensed) under the MIT\n+license terms.\n+\n+In all cases, details of the licensing terms must be provided in the Copyright section of the BIP.\n+\n+#### Acceptable licenses[^licenses]\n+\n+* BSD-2-Clause: [OSI-approved BSD 2-clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)\n+* BSD-3-Clause: [OSI-approved BSD 3-clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)\n+* CC0-1.0: [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\n+* GNU-All-Permissive: [GNU All-Permissive License](http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/License-Notices-for-Other-Files.html)\n+* CC-BY-4.0: [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n+* CC-BY-SA-4.0: [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)\n+* MIT: [Expat/MIT/X11 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n+\n+#### Not acceptable licenses\n+\n+All licenses not explicitly included in the above lists are not acceptable terms for a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal.\n+However, BIPs predating the acceptance of this BIP were allowed under other terms, and should use these abbreviations\n+when no other license is granted:\n+\n+* PD: Released into the public domain\n+* OPL: [Open Publication License, version 1.0](http://opencontent.org/openpub/)\n+\n+## BIP Editors\n+\n+The current BIP editors are:\n+\n+* Bryan Bishop ([kanzure@gmail.com](mailto:kanzure@gmail.com))\n+* Jon Atack ([jon@atack.com](mailto:jon@atack.com))\n+* Luke Dashjr ([luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org](mailto:luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org))\n+* Mark \"Murch\" Erhardt ([murch@murch.one](mailto:murch@murch.one))\n+* Olaoluwa Osuntokun ([laolu32@gmail.com](mailto:laolu32@gmail.com))\n+* Ruben Somsen ([rsomsen@gmail.com](mailto:rsomsen@gmail.com))\n+\n+### BIP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow\n+\n+The BIP editors subscribe to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List and watch the [BIPs\n+repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips).\n+\n+When a new BIP idea is submitted to the mailing list, BIP editors and other community members should comment in regard\n+to:\n+\n+* Novelty of the idea\n+* Viability, utility, and relevance of the concept\n+* Readiness of the proposal\n+* On-topic for the bitcoin community\n+\n+Discussion in pull request comments can often be hard to follow as feedback gets marked as resolved when it is addressed\n+by authors. Substantive discussion of ideas may be more accessible to a broader audience on the mailing list, where it\n+is also more likely to be retained by the community memory.\n+\n+If the BIP needs more work, an editor should ensure that constructive, actionable feedback is provided to the authors\n+for revision. Once the BIP is ready it should be submitted as a \"pull request\" to the [BIPs\n+repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) where it may get further feedback.\n+\n+For each new BIP pull request that comes in, an editor checks the following:\n+\n+* The idea has been previously discussed on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List\n+* Title accurately describes the content\n+* Proposal is of general interest and/or pertains to more than one bitcoin project/implementation\n+* Document is properly formatted\n+* Licensing terms are acceptable\n+* Motivation, Rationale, and Backward Compatibility have been addressed\n+* Specification provides sufficient detail for implementation\n+* The defined Layer header must be correctly assigned for the given specification\n+* The BIP is ready: it is comprehensible, technically feasible, and all aspects are addressed as necessary\n+\n+Editors do NOT evaluate whether the proposal is likely to be adopted.\n+\n+A BIP editor will:\n+\n+* Assign a BIP number and BIP type in the pull request\n+* Merge the pull request when it is ready\n+* List the BIP in the [README](README.mediawiki)\n+\n+The BIP editors are intended to fulfill administrative and editorial responsibilities. The BIP editors monitor BIP\n+changes, and update BIP headers as appropriate.\n+\n+BIP editors may also, at their option, unilaterally make and merge strictly editorial changes to BIPs, such as\n+correcting misspellings, fixing broken links, etc. as long as they do not change the meaning or conflict with the\n+original intent of the authors. Such a change must be recorded in the Changelog if itâ€™s noteworthy per the criteria\n+mentioned in the [Changelog](#changelog) section.\n+\n+## Backward Compatibility\n+\n+### Changes from BIPâ€¯2",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up to\n+the relevant project directly.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors what issues may arise in its progression. After some investigation,\n+the novelty of an idea can be tested by posting about it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). Prior correspondence can be found in the [mailing list\n+archive](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/).\n+\n+Vetting an idea publicly before investing the time to formally describe the idea is meant to save both the authors and\n+the broader community time. Not only may someone point out relevant discussion topics that were missed in the authorsâ€™\n+research, or that an idea is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions, but describing an idea publicly also\n+tests whether it is of interest to more people besides the authors. After establishing that the idea may be of interest\n+to the bitcoin community, the authors should work on drafting a BIP.\n+\n+As a first sketch of the proposal is taking shape, the authors should present it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). This gives the authors a chance to collect initial feedback and address\n+fundamental concerns. If the authors wish to work in public on the proposal at this stage, it is recommended that they\n+open a pull request against one of their forks of the BIP repository instead of the main BIP repository.\n+\n+It is recommended that complicated proposals be split into separate BIPs that each focus on a specific component of the\n+overall proposal.\n+\n+### Progression through BIP Statuses\n+\n+The following sections refer to BIP Status Field values. The BIP Status Field is defined in the Header Preamble\n+specification above.\n+\n+#### Draft\n+\n+After fleshing out the proposal further and ensuring that it is of high quality and properly formatted, the authors\n+should open a pull request to the [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips). The document must adhere to the\n+formatting requirements specified below and should be provided as a file named with a working title of the form\n+\"bip-title.[md|mediawiki]\". The authors must not self-assign a number to their proposal.\n+\n+BIPs that (1) adhere to the formatting requirements, (2) are on-topic, and (3) have materially progressed beyond the\n+ideation phase, e.g. by generating substantial public discussion and commentary from diverse contributors, by\n+independent bitcoin projects working on adopting the proposal, or by the authors working for an extended period toward\n+improving the proposal based on community feedback, will be assigned a number by a BIP editor. The BIP editors should\n+delay number assignment when they perceive a proposal being met with lack of interest: number assignment facilitates the\n+distributed discussion of ideas, but before a proposal garners some interest in the bitcoin community, there is no need\n+to refer to it by a number.\n+\n+Proposals are also not ready for number assignment if they duplicate efforts, disregard formatting rules, are too\n+unfocused or too broad, fail to provide proper motivation, fail to address backwards compatibility where necessary, or\n+fail to specify the feature clearly and comprehensively. Reviewers and BIP editors should provide guidance on how the\n+proposal may be improved to progress toward readiness. Pull requests that are proposing off-topic or unserious ideas or\n+have stopped to make progress may be closed.\n+\n+When the proposal is ready and has been assigned a number, a BIP editor will merge it into the BIP repository. After the\n+BIP has been merged to the repository, its main focus should no longer shift significantly, even while the authors may\n+continue to update the proposal as necessary. Updates to merged documents by the authors should also be submitted as\n+pull requests.\n+\n+#### Complete[^complete]\n+\n+When the authors have concluded all planned work on their proposal, are confident that their BIP represents a net\n+improvement, is clear, comprehensive, has a working reference implementation and test vectors (if applicable), and is\n+ready for adoption by the bitcoin community, they may update the BIPâ€™s status to Complete to indicate that they\n+recommend adoption, implementation, or deployment of the BIP. Where applicable, the authors must ensure that any\n+proposed specification is solid, not unduly complicated, and definitive. Subsequently, the BIPâ€™s content should only be\n+adjusted in minor details, e.g. to improve language, clarify ambiguities, backfill omissions in the specification, add\n+test vectors for edge cases, or address other issues discovered as the BIP is being adopted.\n+\n+A Complete BIP can only move to Deployed or Closed. Any necessary changes to the specification should be minimal and\n+interfere as little as possible with ongoing adoption. If a Complete BIP is found to need substantial functional\n+changes, it may be preferable to move it to Closed[^new-BIP], and to start a new BIP with the changes instead.\n+Otherwise, it could cause confusion as to what being compliant with the BIP means.\n+\n+Complete is the final state for most successful Informational BIPs.\n+\n+#### Deployed\n+\n+A settled[^settled] BIP may be advanced to Deployed upon request by any community member with evidence that the idea\n+described in the BIP is in active use. Such evidence includes for example: at least one project having deployed support\n+for the BIP in mainnet software releases, a soft fork proposalâ€™s activation criteria having been met on the network, or\n+rough consensus for the BIP having been demonstrated.\n+\n+At that point, the BIP should be considered final and any breaking changes to the BIP should be proposed as a new\n+separate BIP.[^new-BIP]\n+\n+##### Process BIPs\n+\n+A Process BIP may change status from Complete to Deployed when it achieves rough consensus on the mailing list. Such a\n+proposal is said to have rough consensus if it has been open to discussion on the development mailing list for at least\n+one month, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it. Addressed or obstructive objections\n+may be ignored/overruled by general agreement that they have been sufficiently addressed, but clear reasoning must be\n+given in such circumstances. Deployed Process BIPs may be modified indefinitely as long as a proposed modification has\n+rough consensus per the same criteria.[^living-documents]\n+\n+#### Closed[^closed]\n+\n+A BIP that is _not in active use_, may be labeled Closed when its authors have stopped working on it, no longer\n+recommend the proposed approach, or no longer pursue adoption of their Complete proposal. The reason for moving the\n+proposal to Closed should be recorded in the Changelog section in the same commit that updates the status.\n+\n+##### Draft â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIP authors may decide on their own to change their BIPâ€™s status from Draft to Closed. If a Draft BIP stops making\n+progress, sees accumulated feedback unaddressed, or otherwise appears stalled for a year, the community may move the BIP\n+to Closed unless the authors assert that they intend to continue work when contacted.\n+\n+##### Complete â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIPs that had attained the Complete status, i.e. that had been recommended for adoption, may be moved to Closed per the\n+authorsâ€™ announcement to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List after not being opposed within four weeks. To successfully\n+oppose the move, at least one of the opposers must volunteer to become the BIPâ€™s author or shepherd for the BIP to\n+remain Complete. A BIP can also be moved to Closed by the community if it has had Complete status for at least one year,\n+there is no evidence of it being in active use, and its authors do not object or fail to respond, unless a new author\n+volunteers within four weeks.\n+\n+##### Deployed â†¦ Closed\n+\n+A BIP may evolve from Deployed to Closed when it is no longer in active use. Any community member may initiate this\n+Status update by announcing it to the mailing list, and proceed if no objections have been raised for four weeks.\n+\n+##### Closed â†¦ Draft\n+\n+The Closed status is generally intended to be a final status for BIPs.\n+\n+If BIP authors decide to make another attempt at a previously Closed BIP, it is generally recommended to create a new\n+proposal. (Obviously, the authors may borrow any amount of inspiration or actual text from any prior BIPs as licensing\n+permits.) The authors should take special care to address the issues that caused the prior attemptâ€™s abandonment. Even\n+if the prior attempt had been assigned a number, the new BIP will generally be assigned a distinct number, unless it is\n+obvious that the new attempt directly continues work on the same idea, in which case it may be reasonable to return the\n+Closed BIP to Draft status.\n+\n+### Changelog\n+\n+To help implementers understand updates to a BIP, any changes after it has reached Complete are tracked with version,",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more expediently.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g. the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g. `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g. \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates in turn that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the bitcoin protocol and bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Small improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up to\n+the relevant project directly.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors what issues may arise in its progression. After some investigation,\n+the novelty of an idea can be tested by posting about it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). Prior correspondence can be found in the [mailing list\n+archive](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/).\n+\n+Vetting an idea publicly before investing the time to formally describe the idea is meant to save both the authors and\n+the broader community time. Not only may someone point out relevant discussion topics that were missed in the authorsâ€™\n+research, or that an idea is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions, but describing an idea publicly also\n+tests whether it is of interest to more people besides the authors. After establishing that the idea may be of interest\n+to the bitcoin community, the authors should work on drafting a BIP.",

Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the bitcoin protocol, bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository records all changes to each BIP transparently and\n+allows any community member to easily retain a complete copy of the archive.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in mediawiki or markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backwards incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment (yyyy-mm-dd)>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC\n+2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions.",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the Bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more clearly.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the Bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the Bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the Bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the Bitcoin protocol, Bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and Bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the Bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what Bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent Bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the Bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more Bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the Bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository transparently records all changes to each BIP and\n+allows any community member to retain a complete copy of the archive easily.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the Bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that Bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in MediaWiki or Markdown[^markdown] format.",

Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any Bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backward incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions on how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of Bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+Multiple authors should be recorded on separate lines:\n+\n+    Authors: Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+             Anata Sample <anata@domain.example>\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format,\n+or \"?\" before a number was assigned.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g., the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.,\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g., `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g., \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP that it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates, in turn, that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits.

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the Bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more clearly.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the Bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the Bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the Bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the Bitcoin protocol, Bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and Bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the Bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what Bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent Bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the Bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more Bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the Bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository transparently records all changes to each BIP and\n+allows any community member to retain a complete copy of the archive easily.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+### What is the scope of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The BIP repository is focused on information and technologies that aim to support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Related topics that are of interest to the Bitcoin community may be acceptable. The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that Bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+BIPs should be written in MediaWiki or Markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any Bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backward incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions on how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of Bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+Multiple authors should be recorded on separate lines:\n+\n+    Authors: Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+             Anata Sample <anata@domain.example>\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format,\n+or \"?\" before a number was assigned.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g., the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.,\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g., `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g., \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP that it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates, in turn, that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a Bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  Bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding Bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the Bitcoin protocol and Bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for Bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the Bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more clearly.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the Bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the Bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the Bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the Bitcoin protocol, Bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and Bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the Bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what Bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent Bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the Bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more Bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the Bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository transparently records all changes to each BIP and\n+allows any community member to retain a complete copy of the archive easily.",

If the Authors agreed to add Shepherds but then fight over the approach of the Shepherds, the involved people should figure it out. In the worst case someone should open a second BIP with the alternate approach.\r\n\r\n> The notion of herding sheep...heh :)\r\n\r\nI was thinking about \"shepherding a process\", but if that first association is shared more commonly, maybe it should be \"Stewards\" after all.\r\n\r\nRegarding whether or not to have a second owner role in the first place: It was requested by several BIP contributors. I donâ€™t feel strongly about it either way. I think itâ€™s a bit convoluted, but I see that such a role would have been used a few times in the past years. \r\nIf it need some minor clarifications, Iâ€™m happy to review suggestions, but if the addition of the Shepherds role would require several more paragraphs to litigate its scope and interactions with the Authors role, Iâ€™d prefer just dropping it altogether.",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the Bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more clearly.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the Bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the Bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the Bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the Bitcoin protocol, Bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and Bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the Bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what Bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent Bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the Bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more Bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the Bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository transparently records all changes to each BIP and\n+allows any community member to retain a complete copy of the archive easily.",

Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any Bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backward incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions on how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of Bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+Multiple authors should be recorded on separate lines:\n+\n+    Authors: Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+             Anata Sample <anata@domain.example>\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format,\n+or \"?\" before a number was assigned.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g., the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.,\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g., `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g., \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP that it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates, in turn, that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a Bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  Bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding Bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the Bitcoin protocol and Bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for Bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the Bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 thus far seems to have been fashioned to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs more often describe interoperable features beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has had multiple debates about the role of BIPâ€¯Editors, and some aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This proposal sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more clearly.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the Bitcoin community. The main topic is technology that supports the Bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the Bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the Bitcoin protocol, Bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and Bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the Bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what Bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent Bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the Bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted.

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the Bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 aimed to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs have more often described interoperational standards beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has debated repeatedly about the role of the BIPâ€¯Editors, and aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This BIP sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more clearly.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the Bitcoin community. The main topic is information and technologies that support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.,\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the Bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the Bitcoin protocol, peer-to-peer network, and client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that Bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the Bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as a point of contact for the BIP in the absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what Bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent Bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the Bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more Bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the Bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository transparently records all changes to each BIP and\n+allows any community member to retain a complete copy of the archive easily.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+Authors may choose to submit BIPs in MediaWiki or Markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any Bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backward incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions on how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of Bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+Multiple authors should be recorded on separate lines:\n+\n+    Authors: Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+             Anata Sample <anata@domain.example>\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format,\n+or \"?\" before a number was assigned.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g., the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.,\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g., `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g., \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP that it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates, in turn, that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a Bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  Bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding Bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the Bitcoin protocol and Bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for Bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Minor improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up directly to\n+the relevant project.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in Bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors of the issues that may arise in its progression. After some investigation,\n+the novelty of an idea can be tested by posting about it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). Prior correspondence can be found in the [mailing list\n+archive](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/).\n+\n+Vetting an idea publicly before investing the time to describe the idea formally is meant to save both the authors and\n+the broader community time. Not only may someone point out relevant discussion topics that were missed in the authorsâ€™\n+research, or that an idea is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions, but describing an idea publicly also\n+tests whether it is of interest to more people besides the authors. After establishing that the idea may be of interest\n+to the Bitcoin community, the authors should work on drafting a BIP.\n+\n+As a first sketch of the proposal is taking shape, the authors should present it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). This gives the authors a chance to collect initial feedback and address\n+fundamental concerns. If the authors wish to work in public on the proposal at this stage, it is recommended that they\n+open a pull request against one of their forks of the BIP repository instead of the main BIP repository.\n+\n+It is recommended that complicated proposals be split into separate BIPs that each focus on a specific component of the\n+overall proposal.\n+\n+### Progression through BIP Statuses\n+\n+The following sections refer to BIP Status Field values. The BIP Status Field is defined in the Header Preamble\n+specification above.\n+\n+#### Draft\n+\n+After fleshing out the proposal further and ensuring that it is of high quality and properly formatted, the authors\n+should open a pull request to the [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips). The document must adhere to the\n+formatting requirements specified above and should be provided as a file named with a working title of the form\n+\"bip-title.[md|mediawiki]\". The authors must not self-assign a number to their proposal.\n+\n+BIPs that (1) adhere to the formatting requirements, (2) are on-topic, and (3) have materially progressed beyond the\n+ideation phase, e.g., by generating substantial public discussion and commentary from diverse contributors, by\n+independent Bitcoin projects working on adopting the proposal, or by the authors working for an extended period toward\n+improving the proposal based on community feedback, will be assigned a number by a BIP editor. The BIP editors should\n+delay number assignment when they perceive a proposal being met with lack of interest: number assignment facilitates the\n+distributed discussion of ideas, but before a proposal garners some interest in the Bitcoin community, there is no need\n+to refer to it by a number.\n+\n+Proposals are also not ready for number assignment if they duplicate efforts, disregard formatting rules, are too\n+unfocused or too broad, fail to provide proper motivation, fail to address backward compatibility where necessary, or\n+fail to specify the feature clearly and comprehensively. Reviewers and BIP editors should provide guidance on how the\n+proposal may be improved to progress toward readiness. Pull requests that are proposing off-topic or unserious ideas or\n+have stopped making progress may be closed.\n+\n+When the proposal is ready and has been assigned a number, a BIP editor will merge it into the BIP repository. After the\n+BIP has been merged to the repository, its main focus should no longer shift significantly, even while the authors may\n+continue to update the proposal as necessary. Updates to merged documents by the authors should also be submitted as\n+pull requests.\n+\n+#### Complete[^complete]\n+\n+When the authors have concluded all planned work on their proposal, are confident that their BIP represents a net\n+improvement, is clear, comprehensive, has a working reference implementation and test vectors (if applicable), and is\n+ready for adoption by the Bitcoin community, they may update the BIPâ€™s status to Complete to indicate that they\n+recommend adoption, implementation, or deployment of the BIP. Where applicable, the authors must ensure that any\n+proposed specification is solid, not unduly complicated, and definitive. Subsequently, the BIPâ€™s content should only be\n+adjusted in minor details, e.g., to improve language, clarify ambiguities, backfill omissions in the specification, add\n+test vectors for edge cases, or address other issues discovered as the BIP is being adopted.\n+\n+A Complete BIP can only move to Deployed or Closed. Any necessary changes to the specification should be minimal and\n+interfere as little as possible with ongoing adoption. If a Complete BIP is found to need substantial functional\n+changes, it may be preferable to move it to Closed[^new-BIP], and to start a new BIP with the changes instead.\n+Otherwise, it could cause confusion as to what being compliant with the BIP means.\n+\n+Complete is the final state for most successful Informational BIPs.\n+\n+#### Deployed\n+\n+A settled[^settled] BIP may be advanced to Deployed upon request by any community member with evidence that the idea\n+described in the BIP is in active use. Such evidence includes for example: at least one project having deployed support\n+for the BIP in mainnet software releases, a soft fork proposalâ€™s activation criteria having been met on the network, or\n+rough consensus for the BIP having been demonstrated.\n+\n+At that point, the BIP should be considered final and any breaking changes to the BIP should be proposed as a new\n+separate BIP.[^new-BIP]\n+\n+##### Process BIPs\n+\n+A Process BIP may change status from Complete to Deployed when it achieves rough consensus on the mailing list. Such a\n+proposal is said to have rough consensus if it has been open to discussion on the development mailing list for at least\n+one month, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it. Addressed or obstructive objections\n+may be ignored/overruled by general agreement that they have been sufficiently addressed, but clear reasoning must be\n+given in such circumstances. Deployed Process BIPs may be modified indefinitely as long as a proposed modification has\n+rough consensus per the same criteria.[^living-documents]\n+\n+#### Closed[^closed]\n+\n+A BIP that is _not in active use_, may be labeled Closed when its authors have stopped working on it, no longer\n+recommend the proposed approach, or no longer pursue adoption of their Complete proposal. The reason for moving the\n+proposal to Closed should be recorded in the Changelog section in the same commit that updates the status.\n+\n+##### Draft â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIP authors may decide on their own to change their BIPâ€™s status from Draft to Closed. If a Draft BIP stops making\n+progress, sees accumulated feedback unaddressed, or otherwise appears stalled for a year, the community may move the BIP\n+to Closed unless the authors assert that they intend to continue work when contacted.\n+\n+##### Complete â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIPs that had attained the Complete status, i.e., that had been recommended for adoption, may be moved to Closed per the\n+authorsâ€™ announcement to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List after not being opposed within four weeks. To successfully\n+oppose the move, at least one of the opposers must volunteer to become the BIPâ€™s author or shepherd for the BIP to\n+remain Complete. A BIP can also be moved to Closed by the community if it has had Complete status for at least one year,\n+there is no evidence of it being in active use, and its authors do not object or fail to respond, unless a new author\n+volunteers within four weeks.\n+\n+##### Deployed â†¦ Closed\n+\n+A BIP may evolve from Deployed to Closed when it is no longer in active use. Any community member may initiate this\n+Status update by announcing it to the mailing list, and proceed if no objections have been raised for four weeks.\n+\n+##### Closed â†¦ Draft\n+\n+The Closed status is generally intended to be a final status for BIPs.\n+\n+If BIP authors decide to make another attempt at a previously Closed BIP, it is generally recommended to create a new\n+proposal. (Obviously, the authors may borrow any amount of inspiration or actual text from any prior BIPs as licensing\n+permits.) The authors should take special care to address the issues that caused the prior attemptâ€™s abandonment. Even\n+if the prior attempt had been assigned a number, the new BIP will generally be assigned a distinct number, unless it is\n+obvious that the new attempt directly continues work on the same idea, in which case it may be reasonable to return the\n+Closed BIP to Draft status.\n+\n+### Changelog\n+\n+To help implementers understand updates to a BIP, any changes after it has reached Complete must be tracked with version,\n+date, and description in a Changelog section. The version number is inspired by semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).\n+The MAJOR version is incremented if changes to the BIPâ€™s Specification are introduced that are incompatible with prior\n+versions (which should be rare after a BIP is Complete, and only happen in well-grounded exceptional cases to a BIP that\n+is Deployed). The MINOR version is incremented whenever the specification of the BIP is changed or extended in a\n+backward-compatible way. The PATCH version is incremented for other changes to the BIP that are noteworthy (bug fixes,\n+test vectors, important clarifications, etc.). Version 1.0.0 is used to label the promotion to\n+Complete. A Changelog section may be introduced during the Draft phase to record significant changes (using versions 0.x.y). An example of a Changelog section can be seen in\n+[BIPâ€¯352](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0352.mediawiki). After a BIP receives a Changelog, the\n+Preamble must indicate the latest version in the Revision header.\n+\n+### Adoption of proposals\n+\n+The BIP repository does not track the sentiment on proposals and does not track the adoption of BIPs beyond whether they\n+are in active use or not. It is not intended for BIPs to list additional implementations beyond the reference\n+implementation: the BIP repository is not a signpost where to find implementations.[^OtherImplementations] After a BIP\n+is advanced to Complete, it is up to the Bitcoin community to evaluate, adopt, ignore, or reject a BIP. Individual\n+Bitcoin projects are encouraged to publish a list of BIPs they implement. A good example of this at the time of writing\n+this BIP can be observed in Bitcoin Coreâ€™s [doc/bips.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/bips.md)\n+file.\n+\n+### Transferring BIP Ownership\n+\n+It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of BIPs to new owners. In general, it would be preferable to\n+retain the original authors of the transferred BIP, but that is up to the original authors. A good reason to transfer\n+ownership is because the original authors no longer have the time or interest in updating it or following through with\n+the BIP process, or have fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e., are unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason\n+to transfer ownership is because someone doesn't agree with the direction of the BIP. The community tries to build\n+consensus around a BIP, but if that's not possible, rather than fighting over control, the dissenters should supply a\n+competing BIP.\n+\n+If someone is interested in assuming ownership of a BIP, they should send an email asking to take over, addressed to the\n+original authors, the BIPâ€¯Editors, and the Bitcoin Development Mailing List. If the authors do not respond in a timely\n+manner (e.g., two weeks), the BIP editors will make a unilateral decision whether to appoint the applicants as\n+[Shepherds](#authors-and-shepherds) (which may be amended should the original authors make a delayed reappearance).\n+\n+## BIP Licensing\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+Each new BIP must identify at least one acceptable license in its preamble. Licenses must be referenced per their\n+respective [SPDX License identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses). New BIPs may be accepted with the licenses described\n+below.\n+",

Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.,\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the Bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the Bitcoin protocol, peer-to-peer network, and client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that Bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the Bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as a point of contact for the BIP in the absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what Bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent Bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the Bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more Bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the Bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository transparently records all changes to each BIP and\n+allows any community member to retain a complete copy of the archive easily.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+Authors may choose to submit BIPs in MediaWiki or Markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any Bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backward incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions on how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>\n+  Title: <BIP title (â‰¤â€¯50 characters)>\n+  Authors: <Authorsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+* Shepherds: <Shepherdsâ€™ names and email addresses>\n+  Status: <Draft | Complete | Deployed | Closed>\n+  Type: <Specification | Informational | Process>\n+  Created: <Date of number assignment, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+  License: <Identifier(s) of acceptable license(s)>\n+* License-Code: <Identifier(s) for Code under different acceptable license(s)>\n+* Discussion: <Mailing list thread(s), or other noteworthy discussion(s) in \"date: URL\" format>\n+* Revision: <Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)>\n+* Requires: <BIP number(s)>\n+* Replaces: <BIP number>\n+* Superseded-By: <BIP number>\n+```\n+\n+__BIP__: The BIP number, or \"?\" before a number was assigned. A proposal must not self-assign a BIP number. Numbers are\n+assigned solely by BIP Editors.\n+\n+__Layer__: The layer of Bitcoin the BIP applies to. See [BIPâ€¯123](bip-0123.mediawiki) for definitions of the various BIP\n+layers.\n+\n+__Title__: A descriptive title of up to 50 characters.\n+\n+__Authors__: The authors header lists the names (or pseudonyms) and email addresses of all authors of the BIP. The\n+format of each authors header value must be\n+\n+    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+\n+Multiple authors should be recorded on separate lines:\n+\n+    Authors: Random J. User <address@dom.ain>\n+             Anata Sample <anata@domain.example>\n+\n+__Shepherds__: The Shepherds header lists additional owners of the BIP. Shepherds stand-in for the original authors of a\n+BIP. The Shepherds header uses the same format as the Authors header. See the [BIP Ownership](#bip-ownership) section\n+above.\n+\n+__Status__: The Status header takes one of the four values Draft, Complete, Deployed, and Closed. The\n+[Workflow](#workflow) section below describes the statuses in detail.\n+\n+__Type__: The Type header specifies the type of BIP: Specification, Informational, or Process. See the [BIP\n+types](#bip-types) section below.\n+\n+__Created__: The Created header records the date that the BIP was assigned a number using ISOâ€¯8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format,\n+or \"?\" before a number was assigned.\n+\n+__License/License-Code__: The SPDX License Identifier(s) of the acceptable licenses under which this BIP is available.\n+See the [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) section below for a description of the acceptable Licenses and their SPDX\n+License Identifiers.\n+\n+If there are multiple licenses, each should be on a separate line.\n+\n+__Discussion__: The Discussion header is used to point the audience to relevant discussions of the BIP, e.g., the mailing\n+list thread in which the idea for the BIP was discussed, a thread where a new version of the BIP was presented, or\n+relevant discussion threads on other platforms. Entries take the format \"yyyy-mm-dd: URL\", e.g.,\n+`2009-01-09: https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10142.html`.\n+\n+Multiple discussions should be listed on separate lines.\n+\n+__Revision__: The Revision header indicates the version of this BIP after a Changelog section has been added. The value\n+is provided as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, e.g., `Revision: 2.3.1`.\n+\n+__Requires__: BIPs may have a Requires header to indicate existing BIPs the new proposal depends on. If multiple BIPs\n+are required, they should be listed in one line separated by a comma and space (e.g., \"1, 2\").\n+\n+__Replaces/Superseded-By__: BIPs may have a Replaces header that contains the number of an older BIP that it renders\n+obsolete. A Superseded-By header indicates, in turn, that a BIP has been rendered obsolete by the later document with the\n+provided number.\n+\n+#### Auxiliary files\n+\n+BIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams and source code. Auxiliary files must be included in a subdirectory\n+for that BIP named `bip-XXXX`, where \"XXXX\" is the BIP number zero-padded to four digits. File names in the subdirectory\n+do not need to adhere to a specific convention.\n+\n+### BIP types\n+\n+* A **Specification BIP** defines a set of technical rules affecting the interoperability of implementations. The\n+  distinguishing feature of a Specification BIP is that it can be implemented, and implementations can be compliant with\n+  it. Specification BIPs should come with or refer to a reference implementation and preferably provide test vectors.\n+* An **Informational BIP** describes a Bitcoin design issue, provides general guidelines or other information to the\n+  Bitcoin community.\n+* A **Process BIP** describes a process surrounding Bitcoin, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process\n+  BIPs are like Specification BIPs, but apply to topics other than the Bitcoin protocol and Bitcoin implementations.\n+  They often require community consensus and are typically binding for the corresponding process. Examples include\n+  procedures, guidelines, and changes to decision-making processes such as the BIP Process.\n+\n+## Workflow\n+\n+The BIP process starts with a new idea for Bitcoin. Each potential BIP must have authorsâ€”people who write the BIP,\n+gather feedback, shepherd the discussion in the appropriate forums, and finally recommend a mature proposal to the\n+community.\n+\n+![Status Diagram](bip-update-process/status-diagram.png \"Status Diagram for the BIP Workflow\")\n+\n+### Ideation\n+\n+After having an idea, the authors should evaluate whether it meets the criteria to become a BIP, as described in this\n+BIP. The idea must be of interest to the broader community or relevant to multiple software projects. Minor improvements\n+and matters concerning only a single project usually do not require standardization and should instead be brought up directly to\n+the relevant project.\n+\n+The authors should first research whether an idea has been considered before. Ideas in Bitcoin are often rediscovered,\n+and prior related discussions may inform the authors of the issues that may arise in its progression. After some investigation,\n+the novelty of an idea can be tested by posting about it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). Prior correspondence can be found in the [mailing list\n+archive](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/).\n+\n+Vetting an idea publicly before investing the time to describe the idea formally is meant to save both the authors and\n+the broader community time. Not only may someone point out relevant discussion topics that were missed in the authorsâ€™\n+research, or that an idea is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions, but describing an idea publicly also\n+tests whether it is of interest to more people besides the authors. After establishing that the idea may be of interest\n+to the Bitcoin community, the authors should work on drafting a BIP.\n+\n+As a first sketch of the proposal is taking shape, the authors should present it to the [Bitcoin Development Mailing\n+List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev). This gives the authors a chance to collect initial feedback and address\n+fundamental concerns. If the authors wish to work in public on the proposal at this stage, it is recommended that they\n+open a pull request against one of their forks of the BIP repository instead of the main BIP repository.\n+\n+It is recommended that complicated proposals be split into separate BIPs that each focus on a specific component of the\n+overall proposal.\n+\n+### Progression through BIP Statuses\n+\n+The following sections refer to BIP Status Field values. The BIP Status Field is defined in the Header Preamble\n+specification above.\n+\n+#### Draft\n+\n+After fleshing out the proposal further and ensuring that it is of high quality and properly formatted, the authors\n+should open a pull request to the [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips). The document must adhere to the\n+formatting requirements specified above and should be provided as a file named with a working title of the form\n+\"bip-title.[md|mediawiki]\". The authors must not self-assign a number to their proposal.\n+\n+BIPs that (1) adhere to the formatting requirements, (2) are on-topic, and (3) have materially progressed beyond the\n+ideation phase, e.g., by generating substantial public discussion and commentary from diverse contributors, by\n+independent Bitcoin projects working on adopting the proposal, or by the authors working for an extended period toward\n+improving the proposal based on community feedback, will be assigned a number by a BIP editor. The BIP editors should\n+delay number assignment when they perceive a proposal being met with lack of interest: number assignment facilitates the\n+distributed discussion of ideas, but before a proposal garners some interest in the Bitcoin community, there is no need\n+to refer to it by a number.\n+\n+Proposals are also not ready for number assignment if they duplicate efforts, disregard formatting rules, are too\n+unfocused or too broad, fail to provide proper motivation, fail to address backward compatibility where necessary, or\n+fail to specify the feature clearly and comprehensively. Reviewers and BIP editors should provide guidance on how the\n+proposal may be improved to progress toward readiness. Pull requests that are proposing off-topic or unserious ideas or\n+have stopped making progress may be closed.\n+\n+When the proposal is ready and has been assigned a number, a BIP editor will merge it into the BIP repository. After the\n+BIP has been merged to the repository, its main focus should no longer shift significantly, even while the authors may\n+continue to update the proposal as necessary. Updates to merged documents by the authors should also be submitted as\n+pull requests.\n+\n+#### Complete[^complete]\n+\n+When the authors have concluded all planned work on their proposal, are confident that their BIP represents a net\n+improvement, is clear, comprehensive, has a working reference implementation and test vectors (if applicable), and is\n+ready for adoption by the Bitcoin community, they may update the BIPâ€™s status to Complete to indicate that they\n+recommend adoption, implementation, or deployment of the BIP. Where applicable, the authors must ensure that any\n+proposed specification is solid, not unduly complicated, and definitive. Subsequently, the BIPâ€™s content should only be\n+adjusted in minor details, e.g., to improve language, clarify ambiguities, backfill omissions in the specification, add\n+test vectors for edge cases, or address other issues discovered as the BIP is being adopted.\n+\n+A Complete BIP can only move to Deployed or Closed. Any necessary changes to the specification should be minimal and\n+interfere as little as possible with ongoing adoption. If a Complete BIP is found to need substantial functional\n+changes, it may be preferable to move it to Closed[^new-BIP], and to start a new BIP with the changes instead.\n+Otherwise, it could cause confusion as to what being compliant with the BIP means.\n+\n+Complete is the final state for most successful Informational BIPs.\n+\n+#### Deployed\n+\n+A settled[^settled] BIP may be advanced to Deployed upon request by any community member with evidence that the idea\n+described in the BIP is in active use. Such evidence includes for example: at least one project having deployed support\n+for the BIP in mainnet software releases, a soft fork proposalâ€™s activation criteria having been met on the network, or\n+rough consensus for the BIP having been demonstrated.\n+\n+At that point, the BIP should be considered final and any breaking changes to the BIP should be proposed as a new\n+separate BIP.[^new-BIP]\n+\n+##### Process BIPs\n+\n+A Process BIP may change status from Complete to Deployed when it achieves rough consensus on the mailing list. Such a\n+proposal is said to have rough consensus if it has been open to discussion on the development mailing list for at least\n+one month, and no person maintains any unaddressed substantiated objections to it. Addressed or obstructive objections\n+may be ignored/overruled by general agreement that they have been sufficiently addressed, but clear reasoning must be\n+given in such circumstances. Deployed Process BIPs may be modified indefinitely as long as a proposed modification has\n+rough consensus per the same criteria.[^living-documents]\n+\n+#### Closed[^closed]\n+\n+A BIP that is _not in active use_, may be labeled Closed when its authors have stopped working on it, no longer\n+recommend the proposed approach, or no longer pursue adoption of their Complete proposal. The reason for moving the\n+proposal to Closed should be recorded in the Changelog section in the same commit that updates the status.\n+\n+##### Draft â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIP authors may decide on their own to change their BIPâ€™s status from Draft to Closed. If a Draft BIP stops making\n+progress, sees accumulated feedback unaddressed, or otherwise appears stalled for a year, the community may move the BIP\n+to Closed unless the authors assert that they intend to continue work when contacted.\n+\n+##### Complete â†¦ Closed\n+\n+BIPs that had attained the Complete status, i.e., that had been recommended for adoption, may be moved to Closed per the\n+authorsâ€™ announcement to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List after not being opposed within four weeks. To successfully\n+oppose the move, at least one of the opposers must volunteer to become the BIPâ€™s author or shepherd for the BIP to\n+remain Complete. A BIP can also be moved to Closed by the community if it has had Complete status for at least one year,\n+there is no evidence of it being in active use, and its authors do not object or fail to respond, unless a new author\n+volunteers within four weeks.\n+\n+##### Deployed â†¦ Closed\n+\n+A BIP may evolve from Deployed to Closed when it is no longer in active use. Any community member may initiate this\n+Status update by announcing it to the mailing list, and proceed if no objections have been raised for four weeks.\n+\n+##### Closed â†¦ Draft\n+\n+The Closed status is generally intended to be a final status for BIPs.\n+\n+If BIP authors decide to make another attempt at a previously Closed BIP, it is generally recommended to create a new\n+proposal. (Obviously, the authors may borrow any amount of inspiration or actual text from any prior BIPs as licensing\n+permits.) The authors should take special care to address the issues that caused the prior attemptâ€™s abandonment. Even\n+if the prior attempt had been assigned a number, the new BIP will generally be assigned a distinct number, unless it is\n+obvious that the new attempt directly continues work on the same idea, in which case it may be reasonable to return the\n+Closed BIP to Draft status.\n+\n+### Changelog\n+\n+To help implementers understand updates to a BIP, any changes after it has reached Complete must be tracked with version,\n+date, and description in a Changelog section. The version number is inspired by semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).\n+The MAJOR version is incremented if changes to the BIPâ€™s Specification are introduced that are incompatible with prior\n+versions (which should be rare after a BIP is Complete, and only happen in well-grounded exceptional cases to a BIP that\n+is Deployed). The MINOR version is incremented whenever the specification of the BIP is changed or extended in a\n+backward-compatible way. The PATCH version is incremented for other changes to the BIP that are noteworthy (bug fixes,\n+test vectors, important clarifications, etc.). Version 1.0.0 is used to label the promotion to\n+Complete. A Changelog section may be introduced during the Draft phase to record significant changes (using versions 0.x.y). An example of a Changelog section can be seen in\n+[BIPâ€¯352](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0352.mediawiki). After a BIP receives a Changelog, the\n+Preamble must indicate the latest version in the Revision header.\n+\n+### Adoption of proposals\n+\n+The BIP repository does not track the sentiment on proposals and does not track the adoption of BIPs beyond whether they\n+are in active use or not. It is not intended for BIPs to list additional implementations beyond the reference\n+implementation: the BIP repository is not a signpost where to find implementations.[^OtherImplementations] After a BIP\n+is advanced to Complete, it is up to the Bitcoin community to evaluate, adopt, ignore, or reject a BIP. Individual\n+Bitcoin projects are encouraged to publish a list of BIPs they implement. A good example of this at the time of writing\n+this BIP can be observed in Bitcoin Coreâ€™s [doc/bips.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/bips.md)\n+file.\n+\n+### Transferring BIP Ownership\n+\n+It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of BIPs to new owners. In general, it would be preferable to\n+retain the original authors of the transferred BIP, but that is up to the original authors. A good reason to transfer\n+ownership is because the original authors no longer have the time or interest in updating it or following through with\n+the BIP process, or have fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e., are unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason\n+to transfer ownership is because someone doesn't agree with the direction of the BIP. The community tries to build\n+consensus around a BIP, but if that's not possible, rather than fighting over control, the dissenters should supply a\n+competing BIP.\n+\n+If someone is interested in assuming ownership of a BIP, they should send an email asking to take over, addressed to the\n+original authors, the BIPâ€¯Editors, and the Bitcoin Development Mailing List. If the authors do not respond in a timely\n+manner (e.g., two weeks), the BIP editors will make a unilateral decision whether to appoint the applicants as\n+[Shepherds](#authors-and-shepherds) (which may be amended should the original authors make a delayed reappearance).\n+\n+## BIP Licensing\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+Each new BIP must identify at least one acceptable license in its preamble. Licenses must be referenced per their\n+respective [SPDX License identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses). New BIPs may be accepted with the licenses described\n+below.\n+\n+For example, a preamble might include the following License header:\n+\n+    License: CC0-1.0\n+             GNU-All-Permissive\n+\n+In this case, the BIP text is fully licensed under both the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license as well as the\n+GNU All-Permissive License, and anyone may modify and redistribute the text provided they comply with the terms of\n+*either* license. In other words, the license list is an \"OR choice\", not an \"AND also\" requirement.\n+\n+It is also possible to license source code differently from the BIP text by including the optional License-Code header\n+after the License header. Again, each license must be referenced by their respective SPDX License identifier shown\n+below.\n+\n+Each source code file or source directory should specify the license under which it is made available as is common in\n+software (e.g., with a license header or a LICENSE/COPYING file). It is recommended to make any test vectors available\n+under CC0-1.0 or GNU-All-Permissive in addition to any other licenses to allow anyone to copy test vectors into their\n+implementations without introducing license hindrances. Licenses listed in the License-Code header apply to all source\n+directories, source code files, and test vectors provided with the BIP except those where a LICENSE file in a directory\n+or the file header states otherwise.\n+\n+For example, a preamble specifying the optional License-Code header might look like:\n+\n+    License:         CC0-1.0\n+    License-Code:    MIT\n+\n+In this case, the code in the BIP is not available under CC0-1.0, but is only available under the terms of the MIT\n+License.\n+\n+BIPs are not required to be *exclusively* licensed under approved terms, and may also be licensed under unacceptable\n+licenses *in addition to* at least one acceptable license. In this case, only the acceptable license(s) should be listed\n+in the License and License-Code headers.\n+\n+It is recommended that BIPs that include literal code be licensed under the same license terms as the project it\n+modifies. For example, literal code intended for Bitcoin Core would ideally be licensed (or dual-licensed) under the MIT\n+license terms.\n+\n+In all cases, details of the licensing terms must be provided in the Copyright section of the BIP.\n+\n+#### Acceptable licenses[^licenses]\n+\n+* BSD-2-Clause: [OSI-approved BSD 2-clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)\n+* BSD-3-Clause: [OSI-approved BSD 3-clause license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)\n+* CC0-1.0: [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\n+* GNU-All-Permissive: [GNU All-Permissive License](http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/License-Notices-for-Other-Files.html)\n+* CC-BY-4.0: [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n+* CC-BY-SA-4.0: [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)\n+* MIT: [Expat/MIT/X11 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n+\n+#### Not acceptable licenses\n+\n+All licenses not explicitly included in the above lists are not acceptable terms for a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal.\n+However, BIPs predating the acceptance of this BIP were allowed under other terms, and should use these abbreviations\n+when no other license is granted:\n+\n+* PD: Released into the public domain\n+* OPL: [Open Publication License, version 1.0](http://opencontent.org/openpub/)\n+\n+## BIP Editors\n+\n+The current BIP editors are:\n+\n+* Bryan Bishop ([kanzure@gmail.com](mailto:kanzure@gmail.com))\n+* Jon Atack ([jon@atack.com](mailto:jon@atack.com))\n+* Luke Dashjr ([luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org](mailto:luke_bipeditor@dashjr.org))\n+* Mark \"Murch\" Erhardt ([murch@murch.one](mailto:murch@murch.one))\n+* Olaoluwa Osuntokun ([laolu32@gmail.com](mailto:laolu32@gmail.com))\n+* Ruben Somsen ([rsomsen@gmail.com](mailto:rsomsen@gmail.com))\n+\n+### BIP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow\n+\n+The BIP editors subscribe to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List and watch the [BIPs\n+repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips).\n+\n+When a new BIP idea is submitted to the mailing list, BIP editors and other community members should comment in regard\n+to:\n+\n+* Novelty of the idea\n+* Viability, utility, and relevance of the concept\n+* Readiness of the proposal\n+* On-topic for the Bitcoin community\n+\n+Discussion in pull request comments can often be hard to follow as feedback gets marked as resolved when it is addressed\n+by authors. Substantive discussion of ideas may be more accessible to a broader audience on the mailing list, where it\n+is also more likely to be retained by the community memory.\n+\n+If the BIP needs more work, an editor should ensure that constructive, actionable feedback is provided to the authors\n+for revision. Once the BIP is ready it should be submitted as a \"pull request\" to the [BIPs\n+repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) where it may get further feedback.\n+\n+For each new BIP pull request that comes in, an editor checks the following:\n+\n+* The idea has been previously discussed on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List\n+* Title accurately describes the content\n+* Proposal is of general interest and/or pertains to more than one Bitcoin project/implementation\n+* Document is properly formatted\n+* Licensing terms are acceptable\n+* Motivation, Rationale, and Backward Compatibility have been addressed\n+* Specification provides sufficient detail for implementation\n+* The defined Layer header must be correctly assigned for the given specification\n+* The BIP is ready: it is comprehensible, technically feasible, and all aspects are addressed as necessary\n+\n+Editors do NOT evaluate whether the proposal is likely to be adopted.",

It replaces [BIPâ€¯2](bip-0002.mediawiki) with a streamlined process, and may be amended to\n+address the evolving needs of the BIP process.\n+\n+## Motivation\n+\n+BIPâ€¯2 is over eight years old and was written when different concerns were pressing to the Bitcoin[^capitalization]\n+community. The BIP process as defined by BIPâ€¯2 aimed to facilitate the design and\n+activation of protocol changes. In the past years, BIPs have more often described interoperational standards beyond the base\n+protocol. The community has debated repeatedly about the role of the BIPâ€¯Editors, and aspects of the process\n+specified by BIPâ€¯2 that did not seem to achieve the intended goals. This BIP sunsets aspects of the BIPâ€¯2 process\n+that did not achieve broad adoption, reduces the judgment calls assigned to the BIP Editor role, and delineates the\n+BIPâ€¯Types more clearly.\n+\n+## Fundamentals\n+\n+### What is a BIP?\n+\n+BIPs cover the range of interests of the Bitcoin community. The main topic is information and technologies that support and expand the utility of the bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.,\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the Bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the Bitcoin protocol, peer-to-peer network, and client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+The scope of the BIP\n+repository is limited to BIPs that do not oppose the fundamental principle that Bitcoin constitutes a peer-to-peer\n+electronic cash system for the bitcoin currency.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the Bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand-in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as a point of contact for the BIP in the absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.\n+\n+### What is the significance of BIPs?\n+\n+BIPs do not define what Bitcoin is: individual BIPs do not represent Bitcoin community consensus or a general\n+recommendation for implementation. A BIP represents a personal recommendation by the BIP authors to the Bitcoin\n+community. Some BIPs may never be adopted. Some BIPs may be adopted by one or more Bitcoin clients or other related\n+software. Some may even end up changing the consensus rules that the Bitcoin ecosystem jointly enforces.\n+\n+### What is the purpose of the BIP repository?\n+\n+The [BIP repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/) serves as a publication medium and archive for mature proposals.\n+Through its high visibility, it facilitates the community-wide consideration of BIPs and provides a well-established\n+source to retrieve the latest version of any BIP. The repository transparently records all changes to each BIP and\n+allows any community member to retain a complete copy of the archive easily.\n+\n+The BIP repository is not a tool to track acceptance[^acceptance], adoption, or community consensus on BIPs, beyond\n+providing a brief overview of BIP statuses (see [Workflow](#workflow) below) to the audience.\n+\n+## BIP format and structure\n+\n+### Specification\n+\n+Authors may choose to submit BIPs in MediaWiki or Markdown[^markdown] format.\n+\n+Each BIP must have a _Preamble_, an _Abstract_, and a _Copyright_ section. Authors should consider all issues in the\n+following list and address each as appropriate. For some BIPs, some concerns may not warrant a dedicated section.\n+\n+* Preamble -- Headers containing metadata about the BIP (see the section [BIP header preamble](#bip-header-preamble)\n+  below).\n+* Abstract -- A short description of the technical issue being addressed.\n+* Motivation -- The motivation is critical for BIPs. It should clearly explain what issue the BIP addresses, and how the\n+  existing situation is inadequate to address the problem that the BIP solves.\n+* Specification -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The\n+  specification should be detailed enough to enable any Bitcoin project to create an interoperable implementation.\n+* Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular\n+  design decisions were made. It should describe related work and alternate designs that were considered. The rationale\n+  should record relevant objections or important concerns that were raised and addressed as this proposal was developed.\n+* Backward compatibility -- A section describing any backward incompatibilities, their severity, and instructions on how\n+  implementers/users should deal with these incompatibilities.\n+* Reference implementation -- Where applicable, a reference implementation, test vectors, and documentation must be\n+  finished before the BIP can be given the status \"Complete\". Any or all of these can be provided either in the BIP or\n+  as auxiliary files (see [Auxiliary Files](#auxiliary-files)).\n+* Changelog -- A section to track modifications to a BIP after reaching Complete status.\n+* Copyright -- The BIP must be placed under an acceptable license (see [BIP Licensing](#bip-licensing) below).\n+\n+#### BIP header preamble\n+\n+Each BIP must begin with an [RFC 822-style header preamble](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/). The headers must\n+appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\\*\" are optional. All other headers are required. The overview is\n+followed by an explanation for each header.\n+\n+```\n+  BIP: <BIP number, or \"?\" before assignment>\n+* Layer: <Consensus (soft fork) | Consensus (hard fork) | Peer Services | API/RPC | Applications>",

The main topic is technology that supports the Bitcoin\n+currency. Most BIPs provide a concise, self-contained, technical description of one new concept, feature, or standard.\n+Some BIPs describe processes, implementation guidelines, best practices, incident reports (e.g.\n+[BIPâ€¯50](bip-0050.mediawiki)), or other information relevant to the Bitcoin community. However, any topics related to\n+the Bitcoin protocol, Bitcoinâ€™s peer-to-peer network, and Bitcoin client software may be acceptable.\n+\n+BIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new protocol features, coordinating client standards, and\n+documenting design decisions that have gone into implementations. BIPs may be submitted by anyone.\n+\n+### BIP Ownership\n+\n+Each BIP is primarily owned by its authors and represents the authorsâ€™ opinion or recommendation. The authors are\n+expected to foster discussion, address feedback and dissenting opinions, and, if applicable, advance the adoption of\n+their proposal within the Bitcoin community.\n+\n+#### Authors and Shepherds\n+\n+Authors may want additional support with the BIP process after writing an initial draft. In that case, they may assign\n+one or more Shepherds to their BIP. Shepherds are stand in owners of a BIP who were not involved in writing the\n+document. They support the authors in advancing the proposal, or act as point-of-contact for the BIP in absence of the\n+authors. Shepherds may perform the role of Authors for any aspect of the BIP process unless overruled by an Author.\n+Shepherds share ownership of the BIP at the discretion of the Authors.",
