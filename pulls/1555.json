    "body": "As Bitcoin has grown, the introduction of new address formats describing new forms of payment instructions has become increasingly fraught with compatibility issues. Not only does there exist traditional on-chain addresses, but some recipients wish to receive Lightning (when the sender supports it) or newer formats such as Silent Payments.\r\n\r\nThis has led to increasing use of the BIP 21 query parameters to encode further optional payment instructions.\r\n\r\nLooking forward, as new payment instructions get adopted, it makes much more sense to include them in query parameters rather than replace the existing address field, ensuring compatibility with senders and recipients who may or may not be upgraded to support all the latest payment instructions.\r\n\r\nThis updates BIP 21 to suggest that future address formats do this.\r\n\r\nFurther, it updates BIP 21 to allow an empty bitcoin address in cases where new payment instructions have moved to becoming mandatory. This isn't a backwards-incompatible change any more than switching to a new address format is, so doesn't impact existing BIP 21 implementations in a new way, however provides a nice conclusion to the query-parameter-based upgrade path - once a form of payment instructions has broad adoption, senders can simply drop the existing address field, keeping their existing query parameter encoding, rather than replace the existing address field. It also addresses the question of what to do if a wallet no longer wishes to receive some legacy on-chain address, but has multiple payment instruction formats that they wish to include - deciding which one to place in the address field would be a difficult task.",

      "body": "(Background discussion for context: https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/revisiting-bip21/630)\r\n\r\nThanks for starting this! Conceptually, I agree with the updates but I think we can get a bigger win by advising the use of HRPs directly instead of key-value pairs. The benefits of this approach are:\r\n\r\n* Better taproot support: using HRPs directly would allow us to construct backwards compatible taproot URIs of the form `bitcoin:bc1q...?bc1p...=o` / `bitcoin:bc1q...?bc1p...`\r\n* Support for future payment instructions: any new payment protocol that encodes their payment instructions using bech32m can be included directly, e.g. `bitcoin:bc1q...?newprotocol1<bech32m encoded data>=o`\r\n* Existing unified QR codes can be made smaller: following an upgrade period to allow clients to update, we would be able to create URIs `bitcoin:bc1q...?lnbc1...=o` (instead of `?lightning=lnbc1...`) and fully static URIs `bitcoin:sp1q...?lno1...=o`\r\n\r\nFor senders, this simplifies implementing support for new address types in that clients can implement support for a generic BIP21 URI using HRPs as keys. As the client supports new bech32m encoded addresses, they are supported automatically without any additional changes.\r\n\r\nClients would still need to support new payment instructions that instead decided to use a query parameter, but I would expect most (if not all) clients to prefer bech32m encodings now that they get BIP21 support for free.\r\n\r\nI wrote a rough draft here, feel free use / modify as needed if you find it useful: https://github.com/josibake/bips/commit/07339bdb929113a9e7218f55ef1bfa72b3976f8e",

This is especially relevant if wallets are using a BIP21 library: my wallet supports new address type `abc1xxxx`, which (according to your proposal) also gets a `abc` key defined (i.e. `abc=abc1xxx`. My wallet can parse the address but since my BIP21 library I am using hasn't added support for the new key, I am unable to parse these URIs. With my proposal of allowing bech32m encoded addresses to be used without a key, everything Just Works.\r\n\r\n> Skipping the key means parsing is a bit trickier if/when we have some new payment instructions that don't use bech32m - do clients need to check the bech32m checksum for unknown payment instruction types? What do they do if its wrong? What happens when someone (without thinking) defines some payment instructions that match a bech32m HRP spuriously (but I guess probably the checksum would be wrong?). These should all be written out and considered if we want to go this path.\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure what you're getting at here? My proposal is that any new payment addresses must use `bech32m` if they want to be used without a key, otherwise they must define a `key`. Everything you just mentioned was predicated on the assumption \"what if they don't use bech32m and don't define a key,\" which means they wouldn't be following the spec.",

      "body": "> No, they are not the same. This is especially relevant if wallets are using a BIP21 library: my wallet supports new address type abc1xxxx, which (according to your proposal) also gets a abc key defined (i.e. abc=abc1xxx. My wallet can parse the address but since my BIP21 library I am using hasn't added support for the new key, I am unable to parse these URIs. With my proposal of allowing bech32m encoded addresses to be used without a key, everything Just Works.\r\n\r\nThat applies both to a K/V parameter and a non-K/V parameter equally - there's really no difference here. A BIP21 parsing library should pass all parameters that it doesn't know.\r\n\r\n> I'm not really sure what you're getting at here?

I'm not really super excited to bake \"future addresses will use bech32m\" into the spec in that way, because at some point we're gonna want \"bech32n\" or some other encoding (which would make sense for stuff that's only in QR codes as you could get the QR a bit denser) and then we'll be back having this same discussion, except now we *have* to shove everything in K/V pairs because we restricted non-K/V pairs to bech32m-only.",

      "message": "Update BIP 21 with information about more modern usage of it\n\nAs Bitcoin has grown, the introduction of new address formats\ndescribing new forms of payment instructions has become\nincreasingly fraught with compatibility issues. Not only does there\nexist traditional on-chain addresses, but some recipients wish to\nreceive Lightning (when the sender supports it) or newer formats\nsuch as Silent Payments.\n\nThis has led to increasing use of the BIP 21 query parameters to\nencode further optional payment instructions.\n\nLooking forward, as new payment instructions get adopted, it makes\nmuch more sense to include them in query parameters rather than\nreplace the existing address field, ensuring compatibility with\nsenders and recipients who may or may not be upgraded to support\nall the latest payment instructions.\n\nThis updates BIP 21 to suggest that future address formats do this.\n\nFurther, it updates BIP 21 to allow an empty bitcoin address in\ncases where new payment instructions have moved to becoming\nmandatory. This isn't a backwards-incompatible change any more than\nswitching to a new address format is, so doesn't impact existing\nBIP 21 implementations in a new way, however provides a nice\nconclusion to the query-parameter-based upgrade path - once a form\nof payment instructions has broad adoption, senders can simply drop\nthe existing address field, keeping their existing query parameter\nencoding, rather than replace the existing address field. It also\naddresses the question of what to do if a wallet no longer wishes\nto receive some legacy on-chain address, but has multiple payment\ninstruction formats that they wish to include - deciding which one\nto place in the address field would be a difficult task.",

One reason I don't like adding new features to a final BIP is well illustrated in the discussion between @TheBlueMatt and @josibake: they each have slightly different visions for the future of `bitcoin:` URIs but Matt will be in a privileged position to push for his vision if the existing and widely linked-to standard of BIP21 is updated to reflect his preferences.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer to see this PR revised to only document how BIP21 is used in practice today, with any new proposals placed in a new BIP (which can, of course, be a 99% copy of the existing text).",
