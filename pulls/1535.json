          "body": "This pull request contains a the same implementation of OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (BIP119) as @jamesob's [Covenant Tools](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28550), an implementation of [OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK(VERIFY)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1535) and of [OP_INTERNALKEY](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1534).\r\n\r\nThere are no testnet or mainnet activation parameters proposed in this pull request. I am deeply uninterested in the details of activation semantics.\r\n\r\nThis combination of changes allows for the implementation of a variety of layer two proposals and improvements. Including, but not limited to, Lightning Symmetry, Point-Time-Locked-Contracts, Timeout Trees, and unidirectional non-interactive channels.\r\n\r\nFor anyone interested, I also have a [branch](https://github.com/reardencode/bitcoin/tree/lnhance-v26) with these same changes based on the latest release.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*** Please remove the following help text before submitting: ***\r\n\r\nPull requests without a rationale and clear improvement may be closed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nGUI-related pull requests should be opened against\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui\r\nfirst. See CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease provide clear motivation for your patch and explain how it improves\r\nBitcoin Core user experience or Bitcoin Core developer experience\r\nsignificantly:\r\n\r\n* Any test improvements or new tests that improve coverage are always welcome.\r\n* All other changes should have accompanying unit tests (see `src/test/`) or\r\n  functional tests (see `test/`). Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review. There is a huge lack of active reviewers on the project, so\r\npatches often sit for a long time.\r\n-->\r\n",

Contributors should note which tests cover\r\n  modified code. If no tests exist for a region of modified code, new tests\r\n  should accompany the change.\r\n* Bug fixes are most welcome when they come with steps to reproduce or an\r\n  explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug\r\n  was fixed.\r\n* Features are welcome, but might be rejected due to design or scope issues.\r\n  If a feature is based on a lot of dependencies, contributors should first\r\n  consider building the system outside of Bitcoin Core, if possible.\r\n* Refactoring changes are only accepted if they are required for a feature or\r\n  bug fix or otherwise improve developer experience significantly. For example,\r\n  most \"code style\" refactoring changes require a thorough explanation why they\r\n  are useful, what downsides they have and why they *significantly* improve\r\n  developer experience or avoid serious programming bugs. Note that code style\r\n  is often a subjective matter. Unless they are explicitly mentioned to be\r\n  preferred in the [developer notes](/doc/developer-notes.md), stylistic code\r\n  changes are usually rejected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBitcoin Core has a thorough review process and even the most trivial change\r\nneeds to pass a lot of eyes and requires non-zero or even substantial time\r\neffort to review.

BIP340 is compatible with any size of message and does not require it to be a securely hashed input, so the message is not hashed prior to BIP340 signing.\n+# Verify NOP upgrade: To bring both ECDSA and BIP340 signing to bitcoin script, a NOP upgrade path was chosen for <code>OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACKVERIFY</code>. This necessarily means leaving the 3 arguments on the stack when executing <code>OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACKVERIFY</code>. Scripts will need to drop or otherwise manage these stack elements.\n+# Add/multisig: No concession is made to <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIG</code> or <code>OP_CHECKSIGADD</code> semantics with <code>OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK(VERIFY)</code>. In Tapscript, add semantics can be implemented with 1 additional vByte per key (<code>OP_TOALTSTACK OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK OP_FROMALTSTACK OP_ADD OP_TOALTSTACK</code>).\n+# Splitting R/S on the stack: Implementing split/separate signatures is left as an exercise for future bitcoin upgrades, such as <code>OP_CAT</code>.\n+# BIP118-style Taproot internal key: Rather than introducing an additional key type in this change, we suggest implementing OP_INTERNALKEY or separately introducing that key type for all Tapscript signature checking operations in a separate change.\n+# Unknown key lengths: The semantics of other signature checking opcodes in their respective script types (legacy, segwit-v0, tapscript-c0) are applied.\n+\n+==Resource Limits==\n+\n+These opcodes are treated identically to other signature checking opcodes and\n+count against the various sigops limits and budgets in their respective script\n+types.\n+\n+==Motivation==\n+\n+===LN Symmetry===\n+\n+When combined with <code>OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY</code> (BIP119/CTV),\n+<code>OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK</code> (CSFS) can be used in Lightning Symmetry channels.\n+The construction <code>OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY <pubkey> OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK</code> is\n+logically equivalent to <code><bip118_pubkey> OP_CHECKSIG</code> and a signature over\n+<code>SIGHASH_ALL|SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT</code>. The <code>OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK</code>\n+construction is 8 vBytes larger.\n+\n+===Delegation===\n+\n+Using a script like:\n+<code>OP_DUP <pubkey> OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK OP_DROP OP_CHECKSIG</code>\n+A script can delegate signing to another key.\n+\n+==Reference Implementation==\n+\n+A reference implementation is provided in provided here:\n+\n+https://github.com/brandonblack/bitcoin/commit/5aae0503ceab93101c459748347a111e4a4852c4\n+\n+==Backward Compatibility==\n+\n+By constraining the behavior of an OP_SUCCESS opcode and an OP_NOP opcode,\n+deployment of the BIP can be done in a backwards compatible, soft-fork manner.\n+If anyone were to rely on the OP_SUCCESS behavior of\n+<code>OP_SUCCESS204</code>, <code>OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK</code> would invalidate\n+their spend.\n+\n+==Deployment==\n+\n+TBD\n+\n+==Credits==\n+\n+Reference implementation was made with reference to the implementation in",

      "body": "Yep. I had the same internal conversation and concluded that the rare cases where CSFSA behavior is needed using the altstack is an acceptable alternative.\r\n\r\nCompared to standard CHECKSIG where CHECKMULTISIG was in active use on legacy/segwitv0 wallets, new wallets or protocols built on CSFS are much more likely to use MuSig2 or FROST when multiple signers are insolved, or (as BitGo's 2-of-3 MuSig2/tapscript wallet does) to have the different signing combinations split between tapscript paths where CSFSV+CSFS are more efficient than CSFSA.",
