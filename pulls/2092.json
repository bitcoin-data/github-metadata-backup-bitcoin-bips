      "body": "No opinions on the content.\r\n\r\nOne editorial or organizational question is whether the table should continue being maintained in BIP324. In principle, it suffices that every new BIP that introduces a message type specifies the corresponding one-byte identifier. But for coordination and accessibility, it's certainly nice to have the full table materialized in a location where it can be found easily. I'm just not entirely sure that BIP324 is the best location for this. It also makes it a bit fuzzy on what document is authoritative, BIP324 or the other BIP?   \r\n\r\nWhat would be the alternative? I think, ideally, we'd have a separate (non-authoritative) document in the BIPs repo (similar to how the README lists all BIPs and their numbers) that has the full table of assignments from message type to short identifier. For each assignment, it would also refer to the BIP that defines this particular assignment. I'd be open to that idea if someone wants to implement it. But otherwise, I guess maintaining it as part of BIP324 is also good enough for now?\r\n",
