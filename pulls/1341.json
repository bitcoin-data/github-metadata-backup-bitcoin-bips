Alternatively if a three-digit number is the only way then I suggest BIP-842 because it matches the bip32 derivation path `m / 84' / 0' / 0' / 2 / index`",

          "title": "Implementing BIP for restoring fidelity bonds from seed phrases",
          "body": "Hello\r\n\r\nI recently [opened a PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1341) to get a BIP number assigned for the standard for storing fidelity bonds in bip39 seed phrases. It can also be read on the gist: https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/7257763cedcc014de2cd4239857cd36e\r\n\r\nThe fidelity bonds in joinmarket are held in bip39 seed phrases. It would be pretty nice if people could restore their fidelity bond coins by importing the same bip39 seed into another wallet, like Electrum. Also it would allow for fidelity bonds to be held in cold storage, allowing the sybil resistance of such systems to increase without hot wallet risk.\r\n\r\nI was thinking write code and open a PR to add this to Electrum along with the other BIP39 wallet types. I'm wondering if anyone has thoughts around the codebase for the best way to do that. I've read a little bit around the codebase already but not much.\r\n\r\nA big difference with the fidelity bonds BIP compared to others like bip44/bip82 is there are not an infinite number of addresses. There are only 960 time-locked addresses, one for each month from 2020-01-01 until 2099-12-01. There are no gap limits, instead the wallet always generates all 960 addresses and sync's them.\r\n\r\nTo actually spend the coin the same witness is required as any other address type: `<signature> <pubkey>`. However the `nLockTime` of the transaction has to be set to greater than the address timelock.\r\n\r\nI'm reading a bit around the Electrum code, for example here: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/9e0a0af81a7dab4fe22aeb007fb5560f48dc6433/electrum/bip39_recovery.py I think the best way is to modify the function `bitcoin.pubkey_to_address` to take an optional parameter `index` which inside the script type can be converted to a timelock value [using the formula from the bip](https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/7257763cedcc014de2cd4239857cd36e#timelock-derivation). Or maybe this can be done in a special if-statement instead of somehow in the `pubkey_to_address` function. Then set the gap limit to be 960. Also somewhere in the GUI should be displayed the timelock as a formatted datetime, perhaps the best way is to set the description field to be automatically set to say `2020-01-01` or whatever the date is.\r\n\r\nIf you have any thoughts for coding this up do let me know. I hope to write the code eventually. Also if you think this is all a really bad idea let me know so I don't waste time coding it up. Though hopefully I can convince you that fidelity bonds are really great, joinmarket already has hundreds of bitcoins locked up some for years, and this provides excellent protection from sybil attacks.

It also defines how to sign fidelity bond certificates, which are needed when using fidelity bonds that are stored offline.\n+\n+== Motivation ==\n+\n+Fidelity bonds are used to resist sybil attacks in certain decentralized anonymous protocols. They are created by locking up bitcoins using the `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` opcode.\n+\n+It would be useful to have a common derivation scheme so that users of wallet software can have a backup of their fidelity bonds by storing only the HD seed and a reference to this BIP. Importantly the user does not need to backup any timelock values.\n+\n+We largely use the same approach used in BIPs 49, 84 and 86 for ease of implementation.\n+\n+This standard is already implemented and deployed in JoinMarket. As most changes would requires a protocol change of a live system, there is limited scope for changing this standard in review. This BIP is more about documenting something which already exists, warts and all.",

It also defines how to sign fidelity bond certificates, which are needed when using fidelity bonds that are stored offline.\n+\n+== Motivation ==\n+\n+Fidelity bonds are used to resist sybil attacks in certain decentralized anonymous protocols. They are created by locking up bitcoins using the `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` opcode.\n+\n+It would be useful to have a common derivation scheme so that users of wallet software can have a backup of their fidelity bonds by storing only the HD seed and a reference to this BIP. Importantly the user does not need to backup any timelock values.\n+\n+We largely use the same approach used in BIPs 49, 84 and 86 for ease of implementation.\n+\n+This standard is already implemented and deployed in JoinMarket. As most changes would requires a protocol change of a live system, there is limited scope for changing this standard in review. This BIP is more about documenting something which already exists, warts and all.\n+\n+It would be useful to be able to keep the private keys of fidelity bonds in cold storage. This would allow the sybil resistance of a system to increase without hot wallet risk.\n+\n+== Background ==\n+\n+=== Fidelity bonds ===\n+\n+A fidelity bond is a mechanism where bitcoin value is deliberately sacrificed to make a cryptographic identity expensive to obtain. A way to create a fidelity bond is to lock up bitcoins by sending them to a timelocked address. The valuable thing being sacrificed is the time-value-of-money.\n+\n+The sacrifice must be done in a way that can be proven to a third party. This proof can be made by showing the UTXO outpoint, the address redeemscript and a signature which signs a message using the private key corresponding to the public key in the redeemscript.\n+\n+The sacrificed value is an objective measurement that can't be faked and which can be verified by anybody (just like, for example PoW mining). Sybil attacks can be made very expensive by forcing a hypothetical sybil attacker to lock up many bitcoins for a long time. JoinMarket implements fidelity bonds for protection from sybil attackers. At the time of writing over 600 BTC in total have been locked up with some for many years. Their UTXOs and signatures have been advertised to the world as proof. We can calculate that for a sybil attacker to succeed in unmixing all the CoinJoins, they would have to lock up over 100k BTC for several years.\n+\n+=== Fidelity bonds in cold storage ===\n+\n+To allow for holding fidelity bonds in cold storage, there is an intermediate keypair called the certificate.\n+\n+    UTXO key ---signs---> certificate ---signs---> endpoint\n+\n+Where the endpoint might be a IRC nickname or Tor onion hostname. The certificate keypair can be kept online and used to prove ownership of the fidelity bond. Even if the hot wallet private keys are stolen, the coins in the timelocked address will still be safe, although the thief will be able to impersonate the fidelity bond until the expiry.\n+\n+=== Fixed timelock values ===\n+\n+It would be useful for the user to avoid having to keep a record of the timelocks in the time-locked addresses. So only a limited small set of timelocks are defined by this BIP. This way the user must only store their seed phrase, and knowledge that they have coins stored using this BIP standard. The user doesn't need to remember or store any dates.\n+\n+\n+== Specifications ==\n+\n+This BIP defines the two needed steps to derive multiple deterministic addresses based on a [[bip-0032.mediawiki|BIP 32]] master private key.

It also defines how to sign fidelity bond certificates, which are needed when using fidelity bonds that are stored offline.\n+\n+== Motivation ==\n+\n+Fidelity bonds are used to resist sybil attacks in certain decentralized anonymous protocols. They are created by locking up bitcoins using the `OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY` opcode.\n+\n+It would be useful to have a common derivation scheme so that users of wallet software can have a backup of their fidelity bonds by storing only the HD seed and a reference to this BIP. Importantly the user does not need to backup any timelock values.\n+\n+We largely use the same approach used in BIPs 49, 84 and 86 for ease of implementation.\n+\n+This standard is already implemented and deployed in JoinMarket. As most changes would requires a protocol change of a live system, there is limited scope for changing this standard in review. This BIP is more about documenting something which already exists, warts and all.\n+\n+It would be useful to be able to keep the private keys of fidelity bonds in cold storage. This would allow the sybil resistance of a system to increase without hot wallet risk.\n+\n+== Background ==\n+\n+=== Fidelity bonds ===\n+\n+A fidelity bond is a mechanism where bitcoin value is deliberately sacrificed to make a cryptographic identity expensive to obtain. A way to create a fidelity bond is to lock up bitcoins by sending them to a timelocked address. The valuable thing being sacrificed is the time-value-of-money.\n+\n+The sacrifice must be done in a way that can be proven to a third party. This proof can be made by showing the UTXO outpoint, the address redeemscript and a signature which signs a message using the private key corresponding to the public key in the redeemscript.\n+\n+The sacrificed value is an objective measurement that can't be faked and which can be verified by anybody (just like, for example PoW mining). Sybil attacks can be made very expensive by forcing a hypothetical sybil attacker to lock up many bitcoins for a long time. JoinMarket implements fidelity bonds for protection from sybil attackers. At the time of writing over 600 BTC in total have been locked up with some for many years. Their UTXOs and signatures have been advertised to the world as proof. We can calculate that for a sybil attacker to succeed in unmixing all the CoinJoins, they would have to lock up over 100k BTC for several years.\n+\n+=== Fidelity bonds in cold storage ===\n+\n+To allow for holding fidelity bonds in cold storage, there is an intermediate keypair called the certificate.\n+\n+    UTXO key ---signs---> certificate ---signs---> endpoint\n+\n+Where the endpoint might be a IRC nickname or Tor onion hostname. The certificate keypair can be kept online and used to prove ownership of the fidelity bond. Even if the hot wallet private keys are stolen, the coins in the timelocked address will still be safe, although the thief will be able to impersonate the fidelity bond until the expiry.\n+\n+=== Fixed timelock values ===\n+\n+It would be useful for the user to avoid having to keep a record of the timelocks in the time-locked addresses. So only a limited small set of timelocks are defined by this BIP. This way the user must only store their seed phrase, and knowledge that they have coins stored using this BIP standard. The user doesn't need to remember or store any dates.\n+\n+\n+== Specifications ==\n+\n+This BIP defines the two needed steps to derive multiple deterministic addresses based on a [[bip-0032.mediawiki|BIP 32]] master private key. It also defines the format of the certificate can be signed by the deterministic address key.\n+\n+=== Public key derivation ===\n+\n+To derive a public key from the root account, this BIP uses a similar account-structure as defined in BIP [[bip-0084.mediawiki|44]] but with <tt>change</tt> set to <tt>2</tt>.\n+\n+<pre>\n+m / 84' / 0' / 0' / 2 / index\n+</pre>\n+\n+A key derived with this derivation path pattern will be referred to as <tt>derived_key</tt> further\n+in this document.\n+\n+For <tt>index</tt>, addresses are numbered from 0 in a sequentially increasing manner, but index does not increase forever like in other similar standards. The index only goes up to <tt>959</tt> inclusive. Only 960 addresses can be derived for a given BIP32 master key. Furthermore there is no concept of a gap limit, instead wallets must always generate all 960 addresses and check all of them if they have a balance and history.\n+\n+=== Timelock derivation ===\n+\n+The timelock used in the time-locked address is derived from the <tt>index</tt>. The timelock is a unix time. It is always the first of the month at midnight. The <tt>index</tt> counts upwards the months from January 2020, ending in December 2099. At 12 months per year for 80 years this totals 960 timelocks.
