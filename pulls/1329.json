First, the leaf version cannot be odd as ''c[0] & 0xfe'' will always be even, and cannot be ''0x50'' as that would result in ambiguity with the annex. In addition, in order to support some forms of static analysis that rely on being able to identify script spends without access to the output being spent, it is recommended to avoid using any leaf versions that would conflict with a valid first byte of either a valid P2WPKH pubkey or a valid P2WSH script (that is, both ''v'' and ''v | 1'' should be an undefined, invalid or disabled opcode or an opcode that is not valid as the first opcode). The values that comply to this rule are the 32 even values between ''0xc0'' and ''0xfe'' and also ''0x66'', ''0x7e'', ''0x80'', ''0x84'', ''0x96'', ''0x98'', ''0xba'', ''0xbc'', ''0xbe''. Note also that this constraint implies that leaf versions should be shared amongst different witness versions, as knowing the witness version requires access to the output being spent.</ref>.\n+*** Let ''pyparity = c[0] & 0x01'', the parity of the Y coordinate of point ''Q''.",
