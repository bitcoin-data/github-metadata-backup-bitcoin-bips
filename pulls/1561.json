    "body": "Given the BIP repository's apparent discontinuation as the appropriate venue for documents of this type, I respectfully propose the deletion of CTV's BIP through this PR's approval. It may be reconsidered for addition once the BIP repository is under active management again.\r\n\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nThe intention is not to suggest that CTV is no longer under consideration; rather, it's to acknowledge that CTV remains a candidate for consideration, just as other proposals such as CAT, CSFS, IKEY, Ephemeral Anchors, 64-bit arithmetic, TXHASH, Taproot Assets, Ordinals, etc are for consideration with neither a BIP number assigned nor have their drafts merged and indexed in the BIPs repository.\r\n\r\nI believe that CTV should not receive any special treatment by having a BIP assigned to it, as it can be evaluated on its own merits alongside these other proposals, or these other documents should also be admitted into the BIP process.",

That's something I'd like to be on the side of, but things like this complicate the ability to defend that position.\r\n\r\nIf this code is not tied to the entirety of your ideas and opinions and stands on its own with its own merits as I believe it does, then this PR to remove it holds no weight.",
