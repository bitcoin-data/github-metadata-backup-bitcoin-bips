      "body": "At least in some cases (for instance in our bitcoin wallet library https://github.com/BP-WG/descriptor-wallet/ by @LNP-BP Association) we do not work with descriptors directly, but instead with \"descriptors templates\", which are directly derived into specific public keys or addresses by providing derivation path pattern, filling in the template. That is why BIP-88 sounded reasonable to me.\r\n\r\nHere, you propose to derive multiple descriptors and handle them separately, which (at least in our case) will result in more code and higher business logic complexity - we basically do not need this. With your BIP proposal we can have a standard guaranteeing that the length of \"derivation pattern\" is always 1, so we can still work with descriptor templates and generate specific public key or address _without_ intermediate step of producing multiple descriptors.\r\n\r\nThus, I suggest to replace the sentence \"parsers should produce multiple descriptors\" in the following way\r\n```suggestion\r\nWhen a <tt>/<NUM;NUM;...;NUM></tt> is encountered, parsers should account for a presence of multiple descriptors where the first descriptor uses the first <tt>NUM</tt>, and a second descriptor uses the second <tt>NUM</tt>, and so on, until each <tt>NUM</tt> is accounted for in public key and/or address derivation, and in descriptor export/import operations.\r\n```",
