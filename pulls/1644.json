    "body": "One important aspect of wallet policies is how they help preventing pubkey reuse. I think it's worth explaining it in some detail in the motivation section.\r\n\r\nAlso adding links to BIP-379, and fixing a nit.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, one might want to formally specify all the miniscript fragments in the grammar specification; however, that would require listing all the miniscript fragments, which doesn't seem useful. As the grammar for miniscript rules are somewhat obvious, I think a simple link to BIP-379 is more useful in practice.",
