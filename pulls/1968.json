    "body": "So I'm doing some work on extending BIP85 functionality on SeedSigner to include GPG key generation, file verification, encrypted messaging, etc, but the resource limitation on low power devices like the Raspberry Pi really makes RSA keys quite painful to use at any useful bit length. (RSA3072 takes 15-20 minutes for a primary key + 3 subs)\r\n\r\nBasically I'm suggesting an expansion of the current functionality to add support for some common ECC curves and provide a bit of a process for future curves to be added in a way that doesn't break existing implementations. (The simplest solution is to just use ECC with key length on the existing RSA derivation, but that doesn't seem very consistent with how BIP85 works for other similar use cases where the derivation path should tell you everything you need to know about the output data/entropy/usage)\r\n\r\nWhile it would have been nice to have a separate derivation level for key_type, that ship has probably sailed, so rather than add that, I am just suggesting a different applicationID for each key type. (Similar to how variations are handled with the existing password application type)\r\n\r\nWhile I'm at it, I'm also suggesting some information about how additional and mixed key types should be handled.\r\n\r\nAnyway, just keen to get some input on a way forward, can add some additional test vectors and stuff once others have provided some input about a preferred way forward.",

I'm developing tools to derive secp256k1 GPG key material on [Krux](https://github.com/selfcustody/krux)\r\nMy implementation differs slightly, as it relies on a [PC-based coordinator app](https://github.com/odudex/gpgap) to handle metadata and prepare files for GPG signing.\r\n\r\nAlthough the approach is different from @3rdIteration’s, he confirmed that the results are compatible, currently using the RSA derivation path in preliminary tests.\r\n\r\nMy long-term goal is to also support the creation of encryption subkeys.\r\n\r\nHaving two independent projects producing different, yet compatible implementations creates an excellent opportunity to include ECC keys in the BIP85 specifications.",

      "body": "> Could this change break anything?\r\n\r\nIt doesn't break the existing RSA implementations, but does add the possibility of having something like an RSA primary key and non-RSA subkeys. (Though the overall RSA fingerprint would remain the same) There is actually already ambiguity in BIP85 as to whether the subkeys should/must have the same key bits as the primary key. (Even if it is a general convention that they align)\r\n\r\nThe use-case to consider here is basically that someone might want to revoke a subkey(s) (or have some expire) and create some additional subkeys that they can continue using while preserving the original primary key. (Which is normal in the context of GPG) \r\n\r\nThe question of whether mixing key types should be allowed is a separate matter, but the use-case for this is basically scenarios where someone may want a strong and long-lived primary key that for their identity, but use different keys for the actual signing and stuff. (Whether due to limitations on smartcards, etc) For example, someone may have an ED25119 primary key and have subkeys use something like P256 or RSA subkeys for compatibility reasons.\r\n\r\n",

(Even though it doesn't seem to me that there are any in the wild) The reality is that new key types will likely continue to be added to GPG, so the ability to add more in a neat way would be better long term. (With the rational for different applications for each key type being related to respecting the status of this BIP as 'Final')\r\n",
