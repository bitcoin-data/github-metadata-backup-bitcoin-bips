    "body": "This document proposes a backwards-compatible second version of the payjoin protocol described in [BIP 78](bip-0078.mediawiki), allowing complete payjoin receiver functionality including payment output substitution without requiring them to host a secure public endpoint. This requirement is replaced with an untrusted third-party relay and streaming clients which communicate using an asynchronous protocol and authenticated, encrypted payloads. It was originally proposed to the mailing list here: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-January/021364.html\r\n\r\nThe protocol has received many rounds of review and an earlier version of this proposal has also been sent to the mailing list: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-August/021868.html\r\n\r\nFeedback from that list post has been incorporated into this draft.\r\n\r\nProposing this as an Standards Track BIP to ensure wallets across the ecosystem can come to rough consensus on a single serverless payjoin standard and correctly implement it.\r\n\r\nA few decisions have yet to reach rough consensus:\r\n\r\n- How should the receiver pubkeys be encoded in the BIP 21 URI? Both base64uri and [Blockchain Commons UR](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md) have been proposed, with the former having more available libraries and the latter better suited for QR encoding.\r\n\r\nThe bip does contain some reference implementations based on earlier versions of this spec, but they must evolve based on the decisions we come to here.",

It does not build yet.\r\n\r\nI'm going to have to link Bria & Payjoin services because payjoin needs utxos and access to a wallet. I think it makes sense for `bria` to be a dependency of the `payjoin` service that hosts the endpoint rather than vice-versa and I'll be digging into it to find out.\r\n\r\nTotally possible I'm going down the wrong path, but I figure I've got to start somewhere to get a server running based on our conversation in #266",

          "body": "The main goal of this pull request is to allow users to create channel with funds outside the node.\r\n\r\nFlow that should be covered:\r\n1) Alice run Node A enabling \"payjoin\" and acting as a \"payjoin receiver\"\r\n2) Alice generates payjoin uri\r\n3) Alice receives a request for payjoin payment from Charlie\r\n4) Alice want to use the funds from the payjoin payment to open a channel with a single transaction.\r\n5) Alice negotiates channel opening with Bob(using the psbt it received in step 3)\r\n6) Alice get `FundingSigned` from Bob\r\n7) Alice send the finalized psbt to Charlie\r\n8) Charlie broadcast the tx\r\n\r\n** This PR should cover Alice part **\r\n\r\nThere are few tricky points, mainly around 6 and 7. Currently transactions are immediately  broadcasted after `FundingSigned`, that wont work with payjoin because the transaction wont be valid.\r\n\r\nThe channel opened is Outbound channel from Alice -> Bob but it will be broadcasted by Charlie, so we need to add some functionality to let Alice node know that its an Outbound channel. \r\n\r\nsome reference for payjoin integration with lnd \r\nhttps://github.com/payjoin/nolooking",

          "body": "Payjoin v2 [BIP 77 spec](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1483) employs [RFC 9180 Hybrid Public Key Encryption](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180.html) (HPKE) for both Oblivious HTTP and end-to-end authenticated encryption between senders and receivers.\r\n\r\nThe BIP specified cryptographic dependencies are [secp256k1-based DHKEM for HPKE](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-wahby-cfrg-hpke-kem-secp256k1-01.html), [RFC 8439 ChaCha20Poly1305 AEAD](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8439], and HKDF-SHA256 since their cryptographic dependencies are already utilized by bitcoin software.\r\n\r\nThe existing [`hpke` crate](https://crates.io/crates/hpke) used for OHTTP uses other cryptographic primitives. The payjoin v2 implementation in this crate uses a secp256k1 hpke implementation defined here rather than the `hpke` crate for sender-receiver AEAD.\r\n\r\nThat's because the [`ohttp`](https://github.com/martinthomson/ohttp) crate does not yet support secp256k1 DHKEM. Since payjoin is designed for bitcoin settings, using secp256k1 and especially the common [`libsecp256k1`](https://docs.rs/libsecp256k1/latest/libsecp256k1/) crate would allow us to reduce dependency burden downstream.\r\n\r\nStabilizing the protocol implementation will require 3 steps\r\n\r\n## 1. Enable Secp256k1 DHKEM and ChaCha20Poly1305 AEAD in the `hpke` crate for `ohttp`\r\n\r\nThis is being tracked by https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/issues/126\r\n\r\nThe underlying `hpke` change is https://github.com/rozbb/rust-hpke/pull/52\r\n\r\n## 2. Replace our HPKE implementation with the more standard `hpke` crate's.\r\n\r\nDeploying a standard HPKE protocol will allow the crate and implementation to be interoperable with other implementations which may crop up even if the underlying implementations of cryptographic primitives change.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to write many tests showing that our protocol conforms with HPKE standards, but it would make more sense to combine our efforts with the better-reviewed-for-that-specific-purpose `hpke` crate.\r\n\r\n#125 Can take place in parallel to #126. \r\n\r\n## 3. Replace RustCrypto dependencies with those shared in the rust-bitcoin ecosystem, like the [`secp256k1`](https://crates.io/crates/secp256k1) libsecp256k1 bindings crate.\r\n\r\nVirtually all downstream bitcoin software uses libsecp256k1 library. It makes sense for us to try to either have that supported in the `hpke` crate or create a fork that relies on libsecp256k1. It may also make sense to use the same chacha20poly1305 rust implementation from `rust-bitcoin` or allow for a crypto provider since some operating systems now support it. Sha256 could come from [`bitcoin-hashes`](https://crates.io/crates/bitcoin_hashes). Using common dependencies allows downstream software to reduce the size  of their dependency tree for both for faster and smaller binary delivery and compile times as well as a reduced attack surface.\r\n\r\n@jbesraa",
