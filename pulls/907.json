      "body": "Was it decided how to signal support for the new `addrv2` type of messages? 3 options have been discussed:\r\n\r\n1. Bump the protocol version (to `70016`).\r\n_pros:_ simple to implement and the info will be available right after the handshake, without changing the handshake itself.\r\n_cons:_ the protocol version is not a bitmap, so if an implementation wants to support `addrv2` then it also has to support all features prior to `70016`, see also https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/766#discussion_r305053562\r\n\r\n2. Use a new network service bit (`NODE_ADDRV2 = (1 << 4)`).\r\n_pros:_ same as 1., see also https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/766#discussion_r336657932\r\n_cons:_ hmm?\r\n\r\n3. Use a new message `sendaddrv2` during the handshake.\r\n_pros:_ can send wider addresses during handshake that would not otherwise fit in `addrMe`, but `addrMe` is deprecated. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/766#issuecomment-524444473\r\n_cons:_ complicates and requires changes to the handshake and requires handling if the new message `sendaddrv2` arrives after the handshake.\r\n",

Otherwise, it's harder too coordinate and get enough review for the change. I'm not even sure people watch these BIP repo PRs much...\r\n\r\nIt's obviously fine to submit minor improvements to already existing BIPs, but *if they are Final*, not when there's a lot of uncertainty :)\r\n\r\nSaid that, I think everyone will be happy if @vasild chooses to move progress on BIP155 forward, I'd just rather see progress in bigger chunks, along with a substantial discussion (mailing list, weekly meeting, etc).",

      "body": "> Increase the maximum length of an address from 32 to 512 bytes and\r\nclarify that the entire message should be rejected if it contains\r\na longer address.\r\n\r\nI agree that this is potentially a worthwhile change because there isn't otherwise any negotiation about what kind of things are permitted inside address messages. Without it a whole v3 address message type would be needed just to support some larger addresses down the line.\r\n\r\nBut makes the maximum size of an addr message 512kb, that is a pretty big slug of latency. Should this increase be couple with a maximum size of the total addr message?\r\n\r\n> Remove a contradiction about unknown address types - \"MUST ignore\" VS\r\n\"MAY store and gossip\". Recommend gossiping addresses for unknown network ID and for networks\r\nto which the node is not currently connected to.\r\n(from #766 (comment))\r\n\r\nI think this is a bad change and it isn't justified by the linked comment.  Gleb's rational is related to networks that are not unknown to you but which you aren't connected to-- such as HS peers for a non HS node.\r\n\r\nI agree that nodes probably should store and forward popular network types that they aren't connected to, subject to the limitation that since they can't test these peers, they can't benefit from the nodes own livelyness detection and might just be garbage-- so it would be entirely understandable if they were deprioritized.\r\n\r\nI don't see any rational given in the link for storing or relaying entirely unknown address types. Particularly since you'll have no way to filter or sanity check these values.\r\n\r\nI think the combination of these two is particularly bad, effectively constructing a moderately high bandwidth free relay mechanism without a current productive use.\r\n\r\nInstead, if a new type is put into use-- what is the harm in older nodes just ignoring it? Eventually they'll upgrade and carry it too.\r\n\r\n> Clarify that the entire message should be rejected if it contains an\r\naddress with unexpected size (e.g. IPv4 address with length 5).\r\n\r\nIn combination with the prior point, this creates a transitive DOS attack in the presence of future or incomplete implementations.  E.g.  IETF smokes a great big bong and creates an IPv8 protocol that has 136 bit addresses. Bitcoin software is updated with a IPv8 type with a limit of 17 byte addresses.  Now I start announcing v8-type addresses with _18_ bytes in them, and non-upgraded peers now suddenly start getting all their addr messages ignored by newer peers because they're relaying address types that they don't understand which violate rules they don't know about.\r\n\r\nCan be resolved by strictly filtering things you know about and not relaying anything else.\r\n",

Gossiping all addresses, regardless of network ID, would be useful for multi-homed nodes and would make it more difficult for an attacker to assess whether a node is multi-homed or not.\r\n\r\nWhat about changing it to:\r\n> Clients are RECOMMENDED to gossip addresses from all known networks even if they are currently not connected to some of them.

And I think based on the history of code in Bitcoin Core, at least, the answer is yes: we try to differentiate between the two for both determining addr relay policy, and for correct implementation of `addr_fetch` peers (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/19694). \r\n\r\nI would add that one of the lessons I learned after implementing BIP 130 (sendheaders) is that reusing `headers` messages as a response to a `getheaders` message, and for unsolicited headers-relay, was a mistake, which has resulted in additional complexity in our headers handling, and has made some problems very hard to solve.  It's long been on my list to revamp how we do headers relay, and in part, disambiguate the two, so that we can handle the different cases more easily.\r\n\r\nI think that same basic lesson applies here: it's basically free to disambiguate between the two, implementations that don't care can just ignore the disambiguation and treat both types of messages the same, while implementations that want to do something different would have the ability to do so.  In my view the main question would be whether it's worth wrapping such a change into this proposal (which has been open for some time and making progress towards deployment), or deferring this proposal to the future?",

      "body": "@sdaftuar I think there may be another angle to this, which makes addr handling very different from block header handling: headers are verifiable data structures, which permit detecting/disconnecting/punishing peers that send invalid ones. Addresses are just unauthenticated data, so if semantics differ between \"addresses just gossipped\" and \"addresses in response to getaddr\", we should be mindful that an attacker could at any time choose between them without any real consequences.\r\n\r\nIt does seem simpler for protocol handling to distinguish them, but wouldn't this work as well?\r\n* After a getaddr, the first 1000 responses - regardless of how they're split over addr messages - are treated as the response to it. This only really matters to ADDR_FETCH nodes.\r\n* All addr messages, regardless of size, are treated as candidates for relay. There is already an existing criterion for relay which will make it mostly false for (honest) responses to getaddr, namely the `nTime` field which must have a timestamp at most 10 minutes in past - as getaddr responses are historical ones, they will generally not qualify. Beyond that we could add a leaky bucket counter or so, that rate limits how many incoming addrs we treat as relayable (to prevent malicious load).\r\n* To prevent spamming/sybilling addrman, use a separate rate limiter to determine when/how many addresses to insert into it from any given peer.\r\n\r\nI'm also happy to be convinced that there aren't any useful attacks that could be used if the two types of responses are distinguished. But given that addr's timestamps are already kind of a proxy for \"currently relyable\", maybe there is no need?",

Remember that we sometimes do unsolicited relay on behalf of other nodes (if addr < 10) and such. \"Malicious load handler\" and rate limiters may be tricked by this too.\r\n\r\n\"Explicit ADDR flag\" is, on the other hand, as robust as current ADDR handling, at least the implementation I envision in context of [#19794](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19794) it can be.\r\n\r\nThis is just my intuition for now, I don't have an exact way of breaking your mechanism, especially since it's only an idea. \r\nMaybe once I see the code, I change my mind.

      "body": "Do we want to require nodes to perform some minimum sanity checks on address types they gossip? Currently the BIP only requires that the length field is enforced. The currently proposed Bitcoin Core implementation https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19845 performs an additional check, namely the TORv3 checksum, but just ignores the item if there's a problem. The BIP lists additional properties that a node could check, such as the public key being a valid ed25519 pubkey. The scenario I'm worried about is an attacker gossiping a whole bunch of nonsense that's expensive for nodes to verify, but with no way to punish them because we can't tighten this rule later.\r\n\r\nI'm also a bit worried about nodes receiving - even if they don't relay - huge amounts of nonsense in the form of fake \"future addresses\". But afaik it doesn't matter what the maximum size is per address, so it's a bit orthogonal to the changes in this PR.",

      "body": "> Addresses are just unauthenticated data, so if semantics differ between \"addresses just gossipped\" and \"addresses in response to getaddr\", we should be mindful that an attacker could at any time choose between them without any real consequences.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is exactly true, at at least it shouldn't be -- \"addresses in response to getaddr\" would only be allowed if a `getaddr` were actually sent (presumably).  I suppose we need semantics around how many response messages a peer could provide; if sending a `getaddr` once allowed the peer to send \"responses\" to that throughout the lifetime of the connection, interspersed with other addr messages, that would be odd.\r\n\r\nHowever if we put some reasonable bounds on the response I think this concern should go away (one simple rule would be that addr-response messages must come sequentially, so that as soon as a network message arrives that isn't an addr-response, the response is over -- we could additionally bound the time from sending a `getaddr` to receiving the responses).  \r\n\r\nWith something like that, we could view addr traffic as two separate protocols:\r\n-  a protocol for unsolicited addr messages\r\n- a protocol for an \"addr_request\" and \"addr_response\" pair of messages\r\n\r\nSo these protocols can only overlap after an addr_request is sent -- outside of such a window, these two protocols are non-overlapping.\r\n\r\nIf we had either one and not the other, it's hard to imagine that the system would be definitely attackable by an adversary, and it's hard for me to imagine that if we had one already, that adding the other would definitely break anything, since mostly these don't overlap.  That is not to say that any given implementation couldn't be broken -- but to argue against having a way to distinguish, I think you'd have to argue that *all* possible (useful) implementations where the two kinds of data are distinguished are definitely attackable?\r\n\r\nI suspect that we have insufficient study/research at this point to be able to make that claim, so given that we have at times in the past (and at present in the Bitcoin Core code) tried to distinguish these cases, I'd say we should go ahead and do so at the protocol level if we have a good opportunity for doing so.  My basic assumption here is that honest nodes participating in this protocol would make some things more efficient, while it shouldn't *necessarily* be more vulnerable to attack by an adversary than today's protocol.",
