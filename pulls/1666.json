The second design goal is ''security'' -- users of the L2 should feel confident that, [https://www.drivechain.info/blog/fees/ if the L2 network is paying a lot of fees], then miners will want to keep it around, and the withdrawals will therefore be processed accurately.\n \n-See [http://www.drivechain.info/ this site] for more information.\n+Once BIP-300 has established a \"bridge\" between L1 and these L2s, users can swap coins in and out instantly, only using BIP-300 for final settlement.

This 32-byte hash identifies the Bundle.\n-\n-This 32-byte hash is what miners will be slowly ACKing over 3-6 months, not the M6 itself (nor any sidechain data, of course).\n+On the L2 side, individual withdrawal requests are periodically combined into a single CoinJoin-like withdrawal bundle.
