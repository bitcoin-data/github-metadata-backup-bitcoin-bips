However, I am happy to adapt this PR to a softfork change on testnet3 if there is consensus for that instead.\r\n- The difficulty adjustment fix suggested here touches the `CalculateNextWorkRequired` function and uses the same logic used in `GetNextWorkRequired` to find the last previous block that was not mined with difficulty 1 under the exceptionf. An alternative fix briefly mentioned on the mailing list by Jameson Lopp would be to \"restrict the special testnet minimum difficulty rule so that it can't be triggered on the block right before a difficulty retarget\". That would also fix the issue but I find my suggestion here a bit more elegant.",

This network comes with small but important improvements of the consensus rules, that should make it impractical to attack the network using only CPU mining.\n+\n+== Motivation ==\n+\n+Quoting the original mailing list post from Jameson Lopp:\n+\n+\"Testnet3 has been running for 13 years. It's on block 2.5 million something and the block reward is down to ~0.014 TBTC, so mining is not doing a great job at distributing testnet coins anymore.\n+\n+The reason the block height is insanely high is due to a rather amusing edge case bug that causes the difficulty to regularly get reset to 1, which causes a bit of havoc. If you want a deep dive into the quirk: https://blog.lopp.net/the-block-storms-of-bitcoins-testnet/\n+\n+Testnet3 is being actively used for scammy airdrops; those of us who tend to be generous with our testnet coins are getting hounded by non-developers chasing cheap gains.\n+\n+As a result, TBTC is being actively bought and sold; one could argue that the fundamental principle of testnet coins having no value has been broken.\"\n+\n+Since then the issue with block storms has been further demonstrated on Testnet 3 when three years' worth of blocks were mined in a few weeks while rendering the network practically unusable at the same time.\n+\n+== Specification ==\n+\n+Consensus of Testnet 4 follows the same rules as Testnet 3 with the exception of the two new rules detailed below.\n+\n+This means that the existing 20 min difficulty exception in Testnet 3 is explicitly kept in place, meaning that a block with a timestamp 20 minutes further into the future from the current time is allowed to have a minimum difficulty of 1 instead of whatever the actual level currently is.\n+\n+=== Block Storm Fix ===\n+\n+When the next work required is calculated for the first block in a new difficulty period, the last block of the previous difficulty period is only used as the base for this calculation if its difficulty is not 1. If its difficulty is 1, all blocks in the previous difficulty period are checked in reverse order if any of them have a different difficulty than 1. When a different difficulty is encountered, it is assumed to be the actual difficulty of the network and used as the base for the calculation of the new difficulty level. Only if all blocks from the previous difficulty period have had a difficulty of 1, this is also used as the base for the calculation of the next difficulty period.\n+\n+=== Time Warp Fix ===\n+\n+To protect against the time warp attack, the following rule proposed as part of The Great Consensus Cleanup is enforced: \"The nTime field of each block whose height, mod 2016, is 0 must be greater than or equal to the nTime field of the immediately prior block minus 600. For the avoidance of doubt, such blocks must still comply with existing Median-Time-Past nTime restrictions.\"\n+\n+== Rationale ==\n+\n+The applied changes were the result of discussions on the mailing list and the PR. The selected changes try to strike a balance between minimal changes to the network (keeping it as close to mainnet as possible) while making it more robust against attackers that try to disrupt the network. Several alternative designs were considered:\n+\n+- For the block storm fix an alternative fix could have been to prevent the last block in a difficulty period from applying the existing difficulty exception. Both solutions were deemed acceptable and there was no clear preference among reviewers.\n+- Removal of the 20-min difficulty exception was discussed but dismissed since several reviewers insisted that it was a useful feature.\n+- Increase of minimum difficulty was discussed but dismissed as it would categorically prevent participation in the network using a CPU miner.\n+- Increase of the delay in the 20 min difficulty exception was suggested but did not receive significant support.\n+- Re-enabling `acceptnonstdtxn` by default on the network was dismissed as it had led to confusion among layer-2s that had used testnet for transaction propagation tests.",

This network comes with small but important improvements of the consensus rules, that should make it impractical to attack the network using only CPU mining.\n+\n+== Motivation ==\n+\n+Quoting the original mailing list post from Jameson Lopp:\n+\n+\"Testnet3 has been running for 13 years. It's on block 2.5 million something and the block reward is down to ~0.014 TBTC, so mining is not doing a great job at distributing testnet coins anymore.\n+\n+The reason the block height is insanely high is due to a rather amusing edge case bug that causes the difficulty to regularly get reset to 1, which causes a bit of havoc. If you want a deep dive into the quirk: https://blog.lopp.net/the-block-storms-of-bitcoins-testnet/\n+\n+Testnet3 is being actively used for scammy airdrops; those of us who tend to be generous with our testnet coins are getting hounded by non-developers chasing cheap gains.\n+\n+As a result, TBTC is being actively bought and sold; one could argue that the fundamental principle of testnet coins having no value has been broken.\"\n+\n+Since then the issue with block storms has been further demonstrated on Testnet 3 when three years' worth of blocks were mined in a few weeks while rendering the network practically unusable at the same time.\n+\n+== Specification ==\n+\n+Consensus of Testnet 4 follows the same rules as Testnet 3 with the exception of the two new rules detailed below.\n+\n+This means that the existing 20 min difficulty exception in Testnet 3 is explicitly kept in place, meaning that a block with a timestamp 20 minutes further into the future from the current time is allowed to have a minimum difficulty of 1 instead of whatever the actual level currently is.\n+\n+=== Block Storm Fix ===\n+\n+When the next work required is calculated for the first block in a new difficulty period, the last block of the previous difficulty period is only used as the base for this calculation if its difficulty is not 1. If its difficulty is 1, all blocks in the previous difficulty period are checked in reverse order if any of them have a different difficulty than 1. When a different difficulty is encountered, it is assumed to be the actual difficulty of the network and used as the base for the calculation of the new difficulty level. Only if all blocks from the previous difficulty period have had a difficulty of 1, this is also used as the base for the calculation of the next difficulty period.\n+\n+=== Time Warp Fix ===\n+\n+To protect against the time warp attack, the following rule proposed as part of The Great Consensus Cleanup is enforced: \"The nTime field of each block whose height, mod 2016, is 0 must be greater than or equal to the nTime field of the immediately prior block minus 600. For the avoidance of doubt, such blocks must still comply with existing Median-Time-Past nTime restrictions.\"\n+\n+== Rationale ==\n+\n+The applied changes were the result of discussions on the mailing list and the PR. The selected changes try to strike a balance between minimal changes to the network (keeping it as close to mainnet as possible) while making it more robust against attackers that try to disrupt the network. Several alternative designs were considered:\n+\n+- For the block storm fix an alternative fix could have been to prevent the last block in a difficulty period from applying the existing difficulty exception. Both solutions were deemed acceptable and there was no clear preference among reviewers.\n+- Removal of the 20-min difficulty exception was discussed but dismissed since several reviewers insisted that it was a useful feature.\n+- Increase of minimum difficulty was discussed but dismissed as it would categorically prevent participation in the network using a CPU miner.\n+- Increase of the delay in the 20 min difficulty exception was suggested but did not receive significant support.\n+- Re-enabling `acceptnonstdtxn` by default on the network was dismissed as it had led to confusion among layer-2s that had used testnet for transaction propagation tests.",
