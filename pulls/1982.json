This pattern allows transactions which are presigned far in advance to leave a \"hook\" for CPFP fee bumping later, when prevailing feerates for block inclusion are better known.\n+\n+When the wallet user is unconcerned by *who* is able to bump the transaction fees as long as someone does, this output type may confer a couple of advantages:\n+\n+1. Using an output type with minimal output and spending input footprint saves fees on average\n+2.

Keyed anchors along with ephemeral dust are also an accepted pattern and as such they remain separate concepts.\n+\n+[bip-0431.mediawiki TRUC transactions]: TRUC transactions bound the topology including child transaction size, which aids in anti-pinning for the P2A output, as anyone can attach a child transaction including an oversized, low feerate one.
