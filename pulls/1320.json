Where they have been used is in HTLCs, which are (IMO -- I could be misreading) very different from what is stated in the BIP.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, BIP-340 links to MuSig, which has a flaw rendering it \"less usable\"/unprovable.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to believe that it's better to be abstract in the applications section, as previous examples in BIPs don't fully stand the test of time, but the concepts do.",

The channel can be between\n-the sender and recipient or a target of recipient's choice.

A new HTLC is required per route that the channel is serving in.\n-In BOLT #2, this maximum number of HTLCs in a channel is hard limited to 483 as the maximum safe\n-size to prevent the transaction from being too large to be valid. In common software implementations\n-such as LND, this limit is set much lower to 12 HTLCS. This is because accepting a larger number of\n-HTLCS makes it more difficult for transactions to confirm during congested periods as they must pay\n-higher fees.\n-Therefore, similarly to how congestion control is handled for normal transaction, lightning channel\n-updates can be done across an CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY tree, allowing nodes to safely use many more\n-HTLCS.\n-Because each HTLC can have its own relative time lock in the tree, this also improves the latency\n-sensitivity of the lightning protocol on contested channel close.\n-\n-===Wallet Vaults===\n-\n-This section will detail two variants of wallet vault that can be built using\n-CTV.  Wallet vaults are a useful tool when greater security is required for\n-cold storage solutions, providing default transactional paths that move funds\n-from one's cold storage to a hot wallet.\n-\n-One type of cold wallet can be set up such that a customer support desk can,\n-without further authorization, move a portion of the funds (using multiple\n-pre-set amounts) into a lukewarm wallet operated by an isolated support desk.\n-The support desk can then issue some funds to a hot wallet, and send the\n-remainder back to cold storage with a similar withdrawal mechanism in place.\n-This is all possible without CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, but CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY\n-eliminates the need for coordination and online signers, as well as reducing\n-the ability for a support desk to improperly move funds.  Furthermore, all such\n-designs can be combined with relative time locks to give time for compliance\n-and risk desks to intervene.

At any time, the remaining\n-balance for the annuity can be cancelled and funds locked entirely in cold\n-storage. The withdrawals to the hot wallet can be 'cancelled' before a maturity\n-date to ensure the action was authorized.

This is a general\n-definition based on the legal definition which even simple scripts using CSV would satisfy.\n-Covenants in Bitcoin transactions usually refer to restrictions on where coins can be transferred.\n-Covenants can be useful to construct smart contracts. As covenants are complex to implement\n-and risk of introducing fungibility discriminants they have not been seriously considered for\n-inclusion in Bitcoin.\n-\n-This BIP introduces a simple covenant called a *template* which enables a limited set of highly\n-valuable use cases without significant risk.\n-\n-A few examples are described below, which should be the subject of future non-consensus\n-standardization efforts.\n-\n-===Congestion Controlled Transactions===\n-\n-When there is a high demand for blockspace it becomes very expensive to make transactions. A large\n-volume payment processor may aggregate all their payments into a single O(1) transaction commitment\n-for purposes of confirmation using CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY. Then, some time later, the payments can\n-be expanded out of that UTXO when the demand for blockspace is decreased. These payments can be\n-structured in a tree-like fashion to reduce individual costs of redemption.\n-\n-The below chart showcases the structure of these transactions in comparison to\n-normal transactions and batched transactions.\n-\n-<img src=\"bip-0119/states.svg\" align=\"middle\"></img>\n-\n-A simulation is shown below of what impact this could have on mempool backlog\n-given 5% network adoption, and 50% network adoption. The code for the simulation\n-is provided in this BIP's subdirectory.\n-\n-<img src=\"bip-0119/five.png\" align=\"middle\"></img>\n-<img src=\"bip-0119/fifty.png\" align=\"middle\"></img>\n-\n-===Payment Channels===\n-\n-There are numerous payment channel related uses.\n-\n-====Batched Channel Creation====\n-\n-Using CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY for Batched Channel Creation is similar to the use for Congestion Control,\n-except the leaf node transactions are channels instead of plain payments. The channel can be between\n-the sender and recipient or a target of recipient's choice. Using an CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, the\n-recipient may give the sender an address which makes a tree of channels unbeknownst to them.\n-These channels are time insensitive for setup, as all punishments are relative timelocked to the\n-penultimate transaction node.\n-Thus, coins sent using a congestion controlled transaction can still enjoy instant liquidity.\n-\n-====Non-Interactive Channels====\n-\n-When opening a traditional payment channel, both parties to the channel must participate. This is\n-because the channel uses pre-signed multi-sig transactions to ensure that a channel can always be\n-exited by either party, before entering.\n-With CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, it’s possible for a single party to construct a channel which either\n-party can exit from without requiring signatures from both parties.\n-These payment channels can operate in one direction, paying to the channel \"listener\" without need\n-for their private key to be online.\n-<img src=\"bip-0119/nic.svg\" align=\"middle\"></img>\n-\n-====Increased Channel Routes====\n-\n-In the Lightning Network protocol, Hashed Time Locked Contracts (HTLCS) are used in the construction\n-of channels. A new HTLC is required per route that the channel is serving in.\n-In BOLT #2, this maximum number of HTLCs in a channel is hard limited to 483 as the maximum safe\n-size to prevent the transaction from being too large to be valid. In common software implementations\n-such as LND, this limit is set much lower to 12 HTLCS. This is because accepting a larger number of\n-HTLCS makes it more difficult for transactions to confirm during congested periods as they must pay\n-higher fees.\n-Therefore, similarly to how congestion control is handled for normal transaction, lightning channel\n-updates can be done across an CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY tree, allowing nodes to safely use many more\n-HTLCS.\n-Because each HTLC can have its own relative time lock in the tree, this also improves the latency\n-sensitivity of the lightning protocol on contested channel close.\n-\n-===Wallet Vaults===\n-\n-This section will detail two variants of wallet vault that can be built using\n-CTV.  Wallet vaults are a useful tool when greater security is required for\n-cold storage solutions, providing default transactional paths that move funds\n-from one's cold storage to a hot wallet.\n-\n-One type of cold wallet can be set up such that a customer support desk can,\n-without further authorization, move a portion of the funds (using multiple\n-pre-set amounts) into a lukewarm wallet operated by an isolated support desk.\n-The support desk can then issue some funds to a hot wallet, and send the\n-remainder back to cold storage with a similar withdrawal mechanism in place.\n-This is all possible without CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY, but CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY\n-eliminates the need for coordination and online signers, as well as reducing\n-the ability for a support desk to improperly move funds.  Furthermore, all such\n-designs can be combined with relative time locks to give time for compliance\n-and risk desks to intervene. This is a 'Coins at Rest' or 'Optically Isolated'\n-vault, and is shown below.\n-\n-<img src=\"bip-0119/vaults.svg\" align=\"middle\"></img>\n-\n-An alternative design for vaults is also highly effective and simpler to\n-implement in Sapio, a smart contract programming language.  In this design, the\n-user commits to a single UTXO that contains a program for an annuity of\n-withdrawals from cold storage to a hot wallet. At any time, the remaining\n-balance for the annuity can be cancelled and funds locked entirely in cold\n-storage. The withdrawals to the hot wallet can be 'cancelled' before a maturity\n-date to ensure the action was authorized. These sort of vaults strongly benefit\n-from non-interactivity because the withdrawal program can be set up with cold\n-keys that are permanently offline, except in case of emergency. The image below\n-shows an instance of this type of wallet vault created with Sapio in Sapio\n-Studio. These types of wallet vault can also be chained together by taking\n-advantage of CTV's scriptSig commitment. This type of vault is a 'Coins in Motion'\n-variant where the coins move along the control path.\n-\n-<img src=\"bip-0119/vaultanim.gif\" align=\"middle\"></img>\n-\n-===CoinJoin / Payment Pools / Join Pools ===\n-\n-CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY makes it much easier to set up trustless CoinJoins than\n-previously because participants agree on a single output which pays all\n-participants, which will be lower fee than before.  Further each participant\n-doesn't need to know the totality of the outputs committed to by that output,\n-they only have to verify their own sub-tree will pay them. These trees can\n-then, using a top-level Schnorr key, be interactively updated on a rolling basis\n-forming a \"Payment Pool\".\n+Covenants are restrictions on how a coin may be spent beyond key ownership.\n+This is a general definition based on the legal definition which even simple\n+scripts using CSV would satisfy.  Covenants in Bitcoin transactions usually\n+refer to restrictions on where coins can be transferred.  Covenants can be\n+useful to construct smart contracts.
