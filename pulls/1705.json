    "body": "While reviewing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31247 a while ago I noticed that the mentioned public keys in the PSBT fields of this BIP are quite confusing. This is mostly due to a non-consistent mention of types (plain vs. x-only) and a purpose that is sometimes missing. This PR aims to improve this in the following ways:\r\n- be specific about the purpose of pubkey types in PSBT fields (\"plain pubkey\" alone doesn't say a lot, especially if it's used repeatedly within a field; explicitly call it \"aggregate pubkey\" or \"participant pubkey\" if applicable)\r\n- replace all uses of \"plain pubkey\" by \"compressed pubkey\" (the only category that should matter is whether the pubkey type is \"x-only\" or \"plain\")\r\n- use consistent word order, e.g. prefer \"compressed aggregate public key\" over \"aggregate compressed public key\"\r\n\r\nAnother possibility would be to even get rid of the \"plain/compressed\" terminology completely. From the fact that \"x-only\" is not explicitly mentioned and the size of 33 bytes it should be obvious that this is a plain public key.",

My impression was that \"compressed\" is significantly less used now than it was in the past (when there was only 65 vs. 33 bytes), especially since x-only pubkeys could then be seen as \"even more compressed\" 😅 \r\n\r\n// EDIT: slightly off-topic for the BIP repo here, but if we change everything to \"compressed\", the RPC help for `decodepsbt` (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31247/commits/abb8228944a213443c7d64e47c60ac96a21cd422) should probably updated to use that as well for consistency",

I find the usage of \"compressed pubkey\" instead much clearer - plain pubkey could also mean a 32 byte pubkey to someone who didn't go through (or remember) BIP 327. \r\n\r\nDifferentiating between \"aggregate\" and \"participant\" pubkeys wherever necessary is also quite helpful for the reader.",
