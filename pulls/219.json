It does describe some\nof the considerations if you decide to do something different.\n\nBut the way these things actually work is:\n\n1) Grumpy engineer who has better things to do gets referred to document\n   as another hurdle they have to jump before finishing what they're\n   trying to do.\n2) They skim the document to see if they have to bother.\n3) If it clearly, says they have to they read the minimum amout to see\n   what they need.\n\nSo, yeah, the default language says \"DO THIS. THEN THIS.  THEN THIS.\nDONE\".  Because I guarantee that nobody will read the rest of it.\n\nCheers,\nRusty.\n",

      "body": "@rustyrussell Regarding the previous point brought up in this PR, I'd very much like to argue in favor of a start date regardless that is part of the BIP9 consensus logic. The reason is that:\n- Experience has shown that some miners and other nodes do in fact run pre-release code, and this does cause problems.\n- The suggestion of not setting a bit until a certain date leads to ambiguous behaviour (for example, the warning logic would need to be more complicated and take bits that you wouldn't set yourself into account).\n- Using a start and end date is a much cleaner way of avoiding bits that depend on each other than defining them recursively (if that's ever needed).\n",

The reason is that:\n> - Experience has shown that some miners and other nodes do in fact run\n>   pre-release code, and this does cause problems.\n\nOK, I respectfully disagree, but I'm often wrong :)\n\n> - Using a start and end date is a much cleaner way of avoiding bits that depend on each other than defining them recursively (if that's ever needed).\n\nI look forward to reading your BIP patch which shows BIP authors how to\nchoose the start date.\n\nPerhaps we should make this the only decision, and make \"end date =\nstart date + 3 years\" (ie. 94608000 seconds)?  That still gives us\nfailed softfork every 6 weeks still.\n\nThanks,\nRusty.\n",

The idea is simply to set the start date reasonably to a time after you plan a stable release. \nNACK against automatically setting the end date. That would create a lack of flexibility and for the time being it's clear 3 year expiry is _way_ too long considering all softforks have been enforced in just a few months. Unless mining decentralises a bit I see no reason for it to take longer unless they actually do reject it, in which case a year is probably a good window.\n\ntl;dr, The start and end dates should be configurable per softfork. The way it is implemented in core PR 7575 is ideal.\n",

But I've already conceded the\nstart date.\n\n> I am very much for a start date and I dont think it needs needs to be complicated. The idea is simply to set the start date reasonably to a time after you plan a stable release. \n\nAs a BIP author, this means I need to know when it's likely to be\nmerged, and what the release cycle timing will be.  So some advice about\nhow to select this would be nice.  Perhaps suggest aiming for 3 months\nafter an expected production release?\n\n> NACK against automatically setting the end date. That would create a lack of flexibility and for the time being it's clear 3 year expiry is _way_ too long considering all softforks have been enforced in just a few months. Unless mining decentralises a bit I see no reason for it to take longer unless they actually do reject it, in which case a year is probably a good window.\n\nOK, let's make it a year then, but let's choose something for BIP9.\nYou could change it for each BIP, just like you could change the\nthresholds, but why would one softfork choose 1 year and one choose 3\nyears?  How would I, as a random BIP author, tell?\n\nWe can always have a new BIP which changes that advice if necessary, but\nI feel that punting to each BIP author is reneging on our\nresponsibilities.\n\nCheers,\nRusty.\n",

      "body": "@rustyrussell I agree BIP9 could recommend some sane defaults. In any case, each softfork BIP already must specify the exact deployment details, for example which bit they intend to use. A typical deployment section for a BIP9 deployment might say \"This will be deployed using BIP9 with bit 5 set with a start date of 2016-04-01 00:00:00 and a timeout of 1 year\".\n\nI would also point out that draft softfork BIPs usually have the deployment section blank as \"TBD\" until exact deployment methodology is known (which is the case for the current BIP68,112 and 113). \n\nAdditionally, we've tended to separate the softfork feature patch and the deployment code. In fact sometimes it's even been necessary to release mempool only code first as was the case of BIP113.\n\nHow about wording for BIP9 something to the effect of:-\n\n\"It is recommended that the '''starttime''' be at least 1 month after expected production release of the softfork proposal, with a '''timeout''' of 1 year.\"\n",

If people like it after\nbikeshedding, I'll open a new PR:\n\n(Moved to a separate section immediately following ==Specification==):\n\n===Selection guidelines===\n\nThe following guidelines are suggested for selecting these parameters for a soft fork:\n\n# '''bit''' should be selected such that no two concurrent softforks use the same bit.\n\n# '''starttime''' should be set to some date in the future, approximately one month software release date including the soft fork.  This allows for some release delays, while preventing triggers as a result of parties running pre-release software.\n\n# '''timeout''' should be 1 year (31536000 seconds) after starttime.\n\nA later deployment using the same bit is possible as long as the starttime is after the previous one's\ntimeout or activation, though it is recommended to have a pause in between to detect buggy software.\n\nCheers,\nRusty.\n",

This indicates another downside this approach: every upgrade permanently restricts the set of allowed nVersion field values.
