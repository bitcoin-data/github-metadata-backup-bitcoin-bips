This BIP defines a protocol to do so using only the DNS, providing for the ability to query such resolutions privately, while utilizing DNSSEC to provide compact and simple to verify proofs of mappings.\r\n\r\nI'd like to hereby request a BIP number assignment. What is the current approach to do so - since the mailing list has died, is a post on delving bitcoin the appropriate place to publish BIP drafts?",
