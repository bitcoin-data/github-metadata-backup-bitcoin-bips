          "body": "There are bunch of things that I'd like to overhaul to make the code cleaner, easier to understand, and easier to use. Although the plan is to make internal changes, some changes will result in breaking the public API. As we (are attempting to) follow semver, that will require a major version bump to 2.0.0. The goal of these changes is to remove several of the hacks that we use, unify path, key origin, xpub, and descriptor handling, and be more pythonic with errors.\r\n\r\nHere's the todo list:\r\n- [x] Introduce `KeyOriginInfo` (done in #374)and unify all key origin handling to use it\r\n- [x] Unify all xpub handling to use `ExtendedKey` rather than the ad hoc stuff we do now\r\n- [x] Redo descriptors more similarly to Core and less hacky.\r\n- [x] Unify how we treat fingerprints. Currently this is ad hoc and is a mix of int, hex string, and bytes.\r\n- [x] Split up `displayaddress` to have multisig and descriptor variants. This command (and the function that it calls) is getting to bulky with mutually exclusive arguments\r\n- [x] Raise exceptions instead of returning error dicts\r\n- [x] Type check everything (except the vendor libraries)\r\n- [x] Document everything with docstrings, write more usage docs, and host it all somewhere. I have been experimenting with using sphinx in a [branch in my repo](https://github.com/achow101/hardware-wallet-interface/tree/sphinx-docs) and have the docs it generates on [readthedocs.io](https://hardware-wallet-interface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\r\n- [x] Specify a new device inclusion policy\r\n\r\nIn the interim, I would also like to get the Bitbox02 stuff merged and then release that as a 1.2. The next release after that should be the 2.0.",

Since HWI doesn't produce PSBTs itself, there won't be anything that breaks the API.",

The transaction version number must be set to at least 2. <ref>'''Why does the transaction version number need to be at least 2?''' The transaction version number is part of the validation rules for some features such as OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY. Since it is backwards compatible, and there are other ways to disable those features (e.g. through sequence numbers), it is easier to require transactions be able to support these features than to try to negotiate the transaction version number.</ref>\n+The Creator should also PSBT_GLOBAL_PREFERRED_LOCKTIME.\n+If the Creator is not also a Constructor and will be giving the PSBT to others to add inputs and outputs, the PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_MODIFIABLE field must be present and and the Inputs Modifiable and Outputs Modifiable flags set appropriately.\n+If the Creator is a Constructor and no inputs and outputs will be added by other entities, PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_MODIFIABLE may be omitted.\n+\n+===Constructor===\n+\n+This Constructor is only present for PSBTv2.\n+Once a Creator initializes the PSBT, a constructor will add inputs and outputs.\n+Before any input or output may be added, the constructor must check the PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_MODIFIABLE field.\n+Inputs may only be added if the Inputs Modifiable flag is True.\n+Outputs may only be added if the Outputs Modifiable flag is True.\n+\n+When an input or output is added, the corresponding PSBT_GLOBAL_INPUT_COUNT or PSBT_GLOBAL_OUTPUT_COUNT must be incremeted to reflect the number of inputs and outputs in the PSBT.\n+When an input is added, it must have PSBT_IN_PREVIOUS_TXID and PSBT_IN_OUTPUT_INDEX set.\n+When an output is added, it must have PSBT_OUT_VALUE and PSBT_OUT_OUTPUT_SCRIPT set.\n+If the input has a required timelock, Constructors must set the requisite timelock field.\n+If the input has a required time based timelock, then PSBT_IN_REQUIRED_TIME_TIMELOCK.\n+If the input has a required height based timelock, then PSBT_IN_REQUIRED_HEIGHT_TIMELOCK.\n+If an input has both types of timelocks, then both may be set.\n+In some cases, an input that can allow both types, but a particular branch supporting only one type of timelock will be taken, then the type of timelock that will be used can be the only one set.\n+\n+If an input being added specifies a required time lock, then the Constructor must iterate through all of the existing inputs and ensure that the time lock types are compatible.\n+Additionally, if during this iteration, it finds that any inputs have signatures, it must ensure that the newly added input does not change the transaction's locktime.\n+If the newly added input has an incompatible time lock, then it must not be added.\n+If it changes the transaction's locktime when there are existing signatures, it must not be added.\n+\n+If the Has SIGHASH_SINGLE flag is True, then the Constructor must iterate through the inputs and find the inputs which have signatures that use SIGHASH_SINGLE.",

The fixed global unsigned transaction\n+cannot be changed which prevents any additional inputs or outputs to be added.\n+PSBT Version 2 is intended to rectify this problem.\n+\n+An additional benficial side effect is that all information for a given input or output will be\n+provided by its <tt><input-map></tt> or <tt><output-map></tt>. With Version 0, to retrieve\n+all of the information for an input or output, data would need to be found in two locations:\n+the <tt><input-map></tt>/<tt><output-map></tt> and the global unsigned transaction. PSBT\n+Version 2 now moves all related information to one place.\n+\n+==Specification==\n+\n+PSBT Version 2 (PSBTv2) only specifies new fields and field inclusion/exclusion requirements.\n+\n+<tt>PSBT_GLOBAL_UNSIGNED_TX</tt> must be excluded in PSBTv2.\n+<tt>PSBT_GLOBAL_VERSION</tt> must be included in PSBTv2 and set to version number 2<ref>'''What happened to version number 1?'''\n+Version number 1 is skipped because PSBT Version 0 has been colloquially referred to as version 1. Originally this BIP was to be\n+version 1, but because it has been colloquially referred to as version 2 during its design phrase, it was decided to change the\n+version number to 2 so that there would not be any confusion</ref>.\n+\n+The new global types for PSBT Version 2 are as follows:\n+\n+{|\n+!

The transaction version number must be set to at least 2. <ref>'''Why does the transaction version number need to be at least 2?''' The transaction version number is part of the validation rules for some features such as OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY. Since it is backwards compatible, and there are other ways to disable those features (e.g. through sequence numbers), it is easier to require transactions be able to support these features than to try to negotiate the transaction version number.</ref>\n+The Creator should also PSBT_GLOBAL_PREFERRED_LOCKTIME.",

The transaction version number must be set to at least 2. <ref>'''Why does the transaction version number need to be at least 2?''' The transaction version number is part of the validation rules for some features such as OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY. Since it is backwards compatible, and there are other ways to disable those features (e.g. through sequence numbers), it is easier to require transactions be able to support these features than to try to negotiate the transaction version number.</ref>\n+The Creator should also set PSBT_GLOBAL_PREFERRED_LOCKTIME.\n+If the Creator is not also a Constructor and will be giving the PSBT to others to add inputs and outputs, the PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_MODIFIABLE field must be present and and the Inputs Modifiable and Outputs Modifiable flags set appropriately.\n+If the Creator is a Constructor and no inputs and outputs will be added by other entities, PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_MODIFIABLE may be omitted.",

The transaction version number must be set to at least 2. <ref>'''Why does the transaction version number need to be at least 2?''' The transaction version number is part of the validation rules for some features such as OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY. Since it is backwards compatible, and there are other ways to disable those features (e.g. through sequence numbers), it is easier to require transactions be able to support these features than to try to negotiate the transaction version number.</ref>\n+The Creator should also set PSBT_GLOBAL_PREFERRED_LOCKTIME.\n+If the Creator is not also a Constructor and will be giving the PSBT to others to add inputs and outputs, the PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_MODIFIABLE field must be present and and the Inputs Modifiable and Outputs Modifiable flags set appropriately.\n+If the Creator is a Constructor and no inputs and outputs will be added by other entities, PSBT_GLOBAL_TX_MODIFIABLE may be omitted.",

      "body": "btw, if the BIP would require signers to add `PSBT_IN_SIGHASH_TYPE` if they used `SIGHASH_SINGLE` for the signature, and finalization to preserve `PSBT_IN_SIGHASH_TYPE`, then constructors could rely on this instead, and they would not need an interpreter. The problem would be older finalizers that can still remove this field, though. Was this bitmap planned to be used essentially for the same purpose ?",
